# syntax=docker.io/docker/dockerfile:1.7

# Kamosu ships as one executable in one distroless image (ADR 0028): no shell,
# no Node, no browser, no model. The binary checks its own health because there
# is no curl to do it. One mount (/data) and one port (5266) are the whole install.
#
# **No model** is the literal truth and not a simplification (ADR 0029): the
# ONNX Runtime that Meaning Search would use is linked into the binary, and the
# weights are not here at all. An Operator who wants them accepts Google's terms
# through an ordinary Operation and Kamosu downloads them into /data — so this
# image carries nobody else's licence, and installs with no network at all.
#
# Every image name is written in full (docker.io/library/…): Podman refuses or
# prompts on a short name like `rust:1.95-slim`, where Docker silently assumes
# Docker Hub. Build with Podman as `podman build --format docker`, or the
# HEALTHCHECK below is dropped. The OCI image format has no field for it.

# The interface is built here and compiled *into* the binary below, never copied
# beside it. Node exists in this stage and nowhere else: the artefact is the
# version, so a half-upgraded install — new binary, last month's assets — is not
# something an operator can arrive at.
