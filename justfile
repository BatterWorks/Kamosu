# failure carries on at the first step not done. Neither force-pushes, moves a
# tag or replaces a published version.

# Prepare a release. The first run cuts docs/release-v<version> from dev, sets
# the version, dates the changelog, runs `just check` and `just test`, and
# opens the version-bump pull request with the release checklist beside a draft
# GitHub Release. Run again once the bump has merged, it opens Release
# v<version> from dev into main. It merges nothing. <version> is bare, as in
# `just release-prepare 0.2.0`.

# in this session. KAMOSU_RELEASE_HOOK names the hook.
