//! A **Backup**: one archive an instance can be restored from — a consistent
//! database snapshot together with the Photographs (#78, ADR 0039).
//!
//! Three archives are kept, on three cadences: one taken every day, one every
//! week, one every month. Each place holds exactly one file, and taking a new
//! one is what prunes the old one, so the directory settles at three.
//!
//! Restoring one is stopping Kamosu, deleting `kamosu.db` and its `-wal` and
//! `-shm` neighbours, and unzipping the archive over `/data`. Deleting the
//! neighbours is the part that matters: the database in an archive carries no
//! write-ahead log, and one left from the old install would replay over it.
//! [`crate::db`] says the same about putting a Snapshot back (ADR 0030).
//!
//! **Nothing here sends a Backup anywhere.** Carrying one off the machine is
//! the Operator's act, through the out-of-band fetch route; a test at the
//! bottom of this file fails the build if this module ever learns to speak to
//! the network.
//!
//! Two things are deliberately *not* in an archive:
//!
//! - **Display Copies and Covers**, which are rebuildable from the Photographs
//!   and would roughly double what an Operator has to store (ADR 0017).
//! - **The downloaded model**, which is 220 MB of somebody else's weights that
//!   `download_meaning_model` fetches again on demand (ADR 0029).
