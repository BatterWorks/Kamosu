//! A **Bundle**: one recipe's worth of Vault (#66, ADR 0020).
//!
//! A plain zip with UTF-8 filenames. At the top level, one readable Markdown
//! note per recipe, the recipe as it reads today with its **Thread** beneath
//! it. Beside the notes, `photographs/`, holding every Photograph any carried
//! Version shows, byte for byte and under a proper name. Beneath them, the
//! hidden `.kamosu/bundle.json`, holding what a machine needs: every Branch's
//! complete chain of Versions (complete states, never deltas), the Readings
//! beside each one, the ids, and which Lineages the Bundle is **about**.
//!
//! This module writes and never reads the database. The Core gathers what
//! travels, under the Credential that asked, and hands it over as
//! [`Contents`]; everything here is about how that looks on disk. That split
//! is also why nothing in this file can widen what a Bundle carries: a field
//! reaches a Bundle only if the Core put it in `Contents`.
//!
//! **The note's layout is the one chosen on 18 September 2026** (layout
//! A on #66, "the plain page"): pure CommonMark and nothing any reader has to
//! understand. No front matter, no wiki links, no callouts. Sections are bold
//! lines, a Component is its written line with one quiet line under it linking
//! to the recipe it names, and the Thread follows a rule, newest first like the
//! Share Link page, with a branch nested under the Version it grew from.
