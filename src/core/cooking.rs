/// the reader's Language and at their unnamed Branch, while a cook may have
/// cooked a variation or the recipe in its other Language. On the recipe page
/// the cook is standing on the Branch they would change; here nobody is, so
/// keeping a variation's cooking onto the plain recipe would replace what the
/// plain recipe says with the variation. Where several Branches hold the
/// Version, a variation carrying its parent's chain for one, the reader's own
/// comes first (`own_first`). Where none the caller sees does, the shelf's
/// Branch is the answer, as it is on the recipe page.
