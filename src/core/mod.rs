//! The Core: where Operations are carried out and where permission is checked.
//! It is reached only through a Door (or the terminal) and knows nothing about
//! how a request arrived.
//!
//! Authorisation lives here, beneath both Doors, keyed on a Credential. A
//! permission check written inside a Door is a bug.
//!
//! This file holds what every caller passes through before any Operation runs:
//! the `Core` itself, startup, `execute` with its permission check, and
//! resolving a Credential. The work behind each Operation lives beside it, one
//! file per area, each adding its methods to `Core` in an `impl` of its own.
//!
//! Four areas are named for what they do rather than what they hold —
//! `carrying_bundles`, `keeping_backups`, `keeping_photographs`,
//! `shopping_list` — because `crate::bundles`, `crate::backups`,
//! `crate::photographs` and `crate::shopping` already exist and the code in
//! those files names them by path.
//!
//! Every area's items are gathered back into this module, so the areas reach
//! one another's helpers through `use super::*` and every `crate::core::X`
//! path still works. How widely each area is re-exported follows what it
//! holds: `pub use` where it has something public, `pub(crate) use` where the
//! widest is crate-wide, and a plain `use` where everything in it is for the
//! other areas only. An area nobody outside it calls into has no line at all.
