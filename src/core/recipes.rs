    ///   entry deleted on its own terms (ADR 0010).

    ///   foreign keys are enforced. A Lineage with no Branch left is an id and
    ///   a date, and costs nothing.
    /// - **`related_recipes`.** It stores both Lineages' names precisely so a
    ///   line stays readable when either leaves the shelf.

    ///   still stand on. A row left naming a Lineage with no Branch is inert:
    ///   Home reads these only as an ordering over recipes already on the
    ///   shelf, so one that is not there cannot be ranked onto it.

    ///   be read (ADR 0024). A thing that quietly disappears from a shopping

/// Nothing at all for a recipe that composes nothing, which is nearly all of
/// them.
///
/// **Flat, depth first, each entry carrying the `path` of line indexes that
/// reaches it.** A tree would be the obvious shape and cannot be declared: ADR
/// 0008 sets no depth limit beyond the repeat guard, and the Catalogue is what
/// the typed client is generated from, so a shape that cannot be declared is a
/// shape the interface silently stops checking. Depth-first order is also the
/// order the page sets a Component's Steps at its foot.
///
/// Three things happen here that are worth knowing before changing any of it.
///
/// **The pointer resolves to a Branch, late.** A Component names a Lineage and
/// never a Version, so it lands on whatever Branch of that dough is in view
/// *now* — which is why editing the dough reaches every recipe using it without
/// minting a Version of any of them. Where it resolves to nothing, `held` is
/// false and there is nothing else to say: the written line already carries the
/// human meaning (ADR 0002), so the screen leaves a sentence rather than a
/// hole. Deleted, never received and held by nobody in view are one case, on
/// purpose — no cascade, no ceremony, no "3 recipes use this".
///
/// **How much is computed and stored nowhere.** `share` is the Reading's
/// quantity over the inner recipe's Yield, worked out at display time by
/// [`units::how_much_of`], carrying the Yield being cooked — ADR 0008's "scaling
/// the outer recipe rescales the Reading, and the factor follows for free" — and
/// it compounds down the chain, so half of a dough that is itself half a starter
/// is a quarter of the starter. A `null` share means Kamosu could not compare
/// the two, and the inner recipe is then handed over exactly as written.
///
/// **A cycle is never refused; unfolding stops.** `walk.open` is the chain of
/// Lineages already open *above* this point, not everything ever seen: two
/// different lines may name the same dough without that being a loop. Meeting
/// one that is already open sets `stopped` and goes no deeper. It is a
/// display-time guard rather than a save-time check because a loop can be
/// assembled from two halves on two servers and arrive already formed — a check
/// at the door could not have held that line and would only give false
