/// the bottom and then merges Foods, which is a Food question rather than a
/// link question. The pizza's flour and its dough's flour are the same row.
///
/// **The unfolding is the very walk the recipe page uses**, repeat guard and
/// all ([`unfold_components`]). Only what is done with each Component differs,
/// and that is the whole of what this function decides:
///
/// - **A Component that opened contributes its inner recipe's Foods and no
///   line of its own.** Its written line — *500 g de pâte à pizza* — comes off
///   the list, because the dough is now on it as flour, water, salt and yeast.
/// - **One that did not keeps its written line and contributes nothing.** A
///   recipe nobody in view holds, and a repeat the walk stopped at, are both
///   this case. A thing that quietly disappears from a shopping list is a
///   thing that does not get bought (ADR 0024), and the written line already
///   carries the human meaning (ADR 0002).
/// - **One Kamosu could not work out a factor for contributes its Foods
///   carrying no amount** — the call made on #86. `2 poignées de pâte`
///   cannot be measured against the dough's Yield, so the dough's flour rides
///   in the *some* bucket ADR 0024 already gives the 28% of Ingredient Lines
///   written with no quantity. Quoting the line instead would leave that flour
///   off the list; folding the whole dough in at full strength would put a
///   figure Kamosu declined to compute inside a row that reads as certain,
///   which is the one thing a merged row cannot say. **Once the factor is lost
///   it stays lost**: a Component nested under an unmeasured one is unmeasured
///   too, because there is nothing honest left to multiply it by.
///
/// Every amount here is for the recipe **as written**. The Yield being shopped
/// for is the outer scale and `shopping::rows` applies it to the lot, so the
/// factor and the Yield compound the way the recipe page's do.
