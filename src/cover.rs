//! The Cover: what leads a recipe with no Main Photo (#46).
//!
//! This is the Rust half of a drawing that lives in two places, and it exists
//! because the Share Link page is rendered by the server as plain HTML (#65,
//! ADR 0012) while the app draws its own Covers in Svelte. The eight dyes and
//! sixteen shapes are **generated** into `cover_faces.rs` from the TypeScript, so
//! the artwork itself cannot drift. What is written twice is the arithmetic
//! below — a hash and four remainders — and the tests at the foot of this file
//! pin it against fixtures taken from the TypeScript, so the two cannot part
//! company without a failing build.
//!
//! Everything about how a Cover looks is derived from the recipe's **Lineage
//! id and nothing else**, which is what makes the promise hold: a rename never
//! changes a recipe's face, a Translation wears its source's face, and the same
//! Lineage wears the same face on every instance it ever reaches — including,
//! now, on a page served to somebody with no account at all.
