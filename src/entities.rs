//! HTML entities left inside text that was never HTML — the one repair every

//!
//! Crouton scrapes a page and stores what it scraped without decoding it, so a

//! a field before writing its JSON-LD leaves the same thing on a web page
//! (#70). Two importers decoding the same text two ways would disagree about
//! the same recipe, which is why neither owns this.

/// Decode the five XML-predefined entities and numeric character references
/// — the only kinds a JSON string value plausibly carries, since it was
/// never HTML to begin with. A run with no `&` at all (the overwhelming
/// majority) costs one scan and no allocation beyond the final `String`.
