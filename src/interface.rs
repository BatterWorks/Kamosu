//! The interface, compiled into the binary (ADR 0028).

//! Kamosu is one executable and one data directory. The Svelte app built from
//! `ui/` is therefore embedded rather than copied beside the binary: the
//! artefact *is* the version, and a half-upgraded install — new binary, last
//! month's asset directory — is unrepresentable.
//!
//! In debug builds `rust-embed` reads `ui/build` from disk instead, so a
//! frontend change recompiles no Rust and `npm run dev` (5174) and
//! `cargo run` (5266) stay two processes side by side.
//!
//! None of this is an Operation. Nothing here enters the Catalogue and Parity
//! is untouched — these routes carry no Credential, only pixels.
