//! Slow work: the Job machinery beneath every Operation declared `Kind::Job`.
//!
//! Asking for a Job records it in the database — the truth about the work, its
//! progress and its result or failure reason (ADR 0003) — and hands it to a
//! **lane**. There are exactly two lanes, and ordinarily which one carries a
//! job depends on who asked, never on what was asked (ADR 0032): members have
//! their own lane, and everything a stranger can cause runs in one depth-one
//! lane behind a short bounded line. When the line is full the ask is refused
//! with *busy*, so the worst a stranger can inflict is latency on other
//! strangers — never collapse.
//!
//! One kind of Job breaks that rule on purpose: the Catalogue may declare a Job
//! `JobLane::AlwaysSingle` when its risk lives in the outbound fetch itself
//! rather than in who asked for it (the web-link importer, #70 — a page's own
//! text can tell an agent to fetch another URL, ADR 0033). Such a Job always
//! takes the single depth-one lane, member or not.
//!
//! An **agent's Job** is the one kind that takes no lane at all (ADR 0048). A
//! Runner beside Kamosu takes it and an agent does the work, so the row waits
//! queued until then, and a restart leaves it as it was.
//!
//! A streaming progress mechanism, if one ever exists, may decorate this but is
//! never instead of it: the row in this table is where watching slow work reads.
