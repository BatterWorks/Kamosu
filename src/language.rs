//! The Language a Branch is written in, and reading it out of the recipe's own
//! text (ADR 0006, #56).
//!
//! Kamosu detects a Language and never asserts one: detection **sets** the
//! Language when a Branch has none to disagree with, and **offers** it when it
//! disagrees with one already there. Nothing here ever writes over a Language a
//! cook has stated — that is [`crate::core::Core::set_recipe_language`]'s job,
//! and it makes a Version.
//!
//! **Unknown** is a real Language here, not the absence of one. A recipe
//! honestly written in two — a French ingredient heading under an English
//! title, which the real 86-recipe corpus contains — carries it permanently,
//! shows to every reader whatever they read in, and is never offered anything.
//! No detector can be right about such a recipe, so Kamosu does not pretend to
//! be: it offers the cook a place to say so instead.
//!
//! The detector is `whatlang`, restricted to the Languages Kamosu is written in
//! and gated on its own `is_reliable`. Restricting it matters: an
//! unrestricted detector asked about "Sukiyaki Udon" reaches for Japanese,
//! which is not one of the answers Kamosu has. The gate matters just as much —
//! a recipe that is nothing but a title and a link (the corpus holds three) is
//! far too little text to read a Language out of, and the honest answer there
//! is none.
//!
//! **German is on the detector's list and is no answer.** With Dutch alone
//! added, all four German recipes in a library of 205 were read as Dutch (#494).
//! Listed, they are read as German, and answered as none, as they always were.
