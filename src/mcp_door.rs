//! The MCP door: built by walking the Catalogue, like the web door.
//!
//! Speaks MCP revision `2026-07-28` only — stateless, no handshake. A legacy
//! `initialize` receives a courteous error naming the version this door speaks,
//! and `server/discover`, which that revision requires of every server, says
//! the same thing to a modern client before it asks for anything else (#143).
//! Every other request must carry the headers and `_meta` fields that revision
//! requires, and one missing any is refused with a message naming what to
//! send (#144).
//!
//! It carries the standard long-running-task extension
//! (`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`): asking for an Operation declared `Kind::Job`
//! answers a `CreateTaskResult`, whose taskId is Kamosu's job id, and the client
//! polls `tasks/get` until the work ends. A client that did not declare the
//! extension gets the Job's ordinary `{ job_id }` instead and polls `get_job`
//! (#146). Underneath, the tasks path is decoration over ordinary Operations —
//! every poll reads through `get_job`, exactly what the web door serves, so
//! watching slow work is never a feature of one Door alone.
//!
//! It answers no web page: a request carrying an `Origin` header is refused
//! before anything else about it is read (#145).
