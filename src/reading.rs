//! Reading an Ingredient Line — laying a **Reading** over what the cook wrote
//! without touching a character of it (ADR 0002, ADR 0021, #71).
//!
//! **The written line is the truth and nothing here changes it.** What this
//! module produces is the optional second half of ADR 0002: how much, in what
//! **Unit**, of what. A line it cannot read gets no Reading, which is not an
//! error and not a rare case — 239 of the 863 real Ingredient Lines in the
//! corpus carry no quantity at all, and every one of them is a working line.
//!
//! **A Reading produced here is Kamosu's reading, not the cook's** (ADR 0021).
//! It makes no Version, appears in no Thread, and is no part of a fingerprint,
//! which is exactly what lets a future change to this file improve every
//! Reading in the library without re-fingerprinting a single recipe.
//!
//! ## Why this is Kamosu's own code and not a library
//!
//! #71 originally deferred this to an `ingredient-parser-nlp` subprocess
//! worker. Measured against the corpus, the two credible libraries both lost
//! to ninety lines resting on [`crate::units`] — because both carry their own
//! **English-only** vocabulary of Units, and Kamosu already has that
//! vocabulary in three Languages. `20 cl de crème fraîche` is a line neither
//! library reads and this one does. See ADR 0036 for the measurement.
//!
//! **So the split is the only thing here.** Where the number ends, where the
//! Unit ends and where the Food begins is this module's whole question;
//! *what the number is worth* is [`crate::units::parse_amount`] and *what the
//! Unit is* is [`crate::units::recognise`], both of which already existed.
//!
//! ## The one rule that shapes the rest
//!
//! **The set of Units is open; the set Kamosu can convert is closed.** A word
//! is read as a Unit when the closed set knows it, or when it is one of the
//! vessels and handfuls below — never merely because it stands where a Unit
//! would stand. Without that restraint `3 chicken breasts` reads *chicken* as
//! a Unit of breasts, and a Food list fills with words that are not foods.
//!
//! [`OPEN_UNITS`] is therefore not a second vocabulary competing with
//! [`crate::units`], which was the whole objection to the libraries: it is the
//! **open** half ADR 0016 says `units.rs` deliberately does not hold, because
//! nothing in it converts to anything. `units.rs` answers *what is this Unit
//! worth*; these words never have an answer, and are listed here only so the
//! split knows where a Food begins. Every word that does convert is looked up
//! there and defined nowhere else.
