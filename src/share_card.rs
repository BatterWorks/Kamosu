//! The picture a messaging app shows when a Share Link is sent (#65).
//!
//! It is **the page's own hero**, drawn again at card size: the photograph
//! under the indigo wash with the recipe's name standing on it, or — for the
//! roughly one recipe in three with no photograph — its Cover, carrying the
//! name bare, because a Cover's dye was chosen and needs no wash (#46, #81).
//!
//! Why the name is on the picture rather than left to the chat: every client
//! prints `og:title` as text beneath the image, so a name in both places is the
//! one thing that reads twice. #65 settled this — the name is set
//! once, here, and `og:title` says who shared it instead.
//!
//! Why it is drawn at all, rather than serving the photograph as it stands: a
//! recipe with no photograph would otherwise arrive as a naked URL, and the
//! recipe's name is the single most useful thing a card can carry.
//!
//! What this needs that nothing else in Kamosu did: a rasteriser. There is one.
//! `skrifa` reads the title out of the font as outlines and `tiny-skia` fills
//! them, the same call that fills a Cover's bezier shapes — so a letter and a
//! Cover are the same kind of thing by the time either reaches a pixel. The
//! alternative was a full SVG engine, which is an order of magnitude more
//! crates for a picture whose entire vocabulary is *five path commands and one
//! line of text*.
