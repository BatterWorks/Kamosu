//! Shopping Rows: what a **Shopping List** says once its recipes have been
//! read (ADR 0024, #73).
//!
//! **The choosing is stored; the rows are computed.** Nothing here is ever
//! written down — `core` holds the choosing, hands this module one
//! [`Contribution`] per Ingredient Line of every chosen recipe, and gets back
//! the rows to answer with. Run it twice and it says the same thing twice;
//! correct a Reading in between and it says something else, which is the whole
//! reason a row is not stored.
//!
//! ## The one thing this file decides
//!
//! **How many amounts a row carries, and which.** Contributions fall into
//! buckets that can honestly be added to each other and never across:
//!
//! - **mass** — grams, however they were written. A customary volume of a Food
//!   with a Cup Weight lands here too, which is the one crossing ADR 0016
//!   allows and the whole reason a Cup Weight exists.
//! - **volume** — millilitres.
//! - **count** — a number with no Unit at all: `3 large eggs`.
//! - **as written** — a number with a Unit outside the closed convertible set,
//!   kept per word: `4 cloves`, `2 poignées`. Two recipes' *cloves* add — and
//!   so do one recipe's *clove* and another's *cloves*, which is all
//!   [`unit_key`] exists for. A clove and a handful never do. A reader who
//!   asked for her measures to be
//!   left **as written** puts every Unit here, known or not: leaving a Unit
//!   alone and converting it are the same act, and she asked for neither.
//! - **no amount** — a line carrying no quantity at all, which is 28% of real
//!   Ingredient Lines (#5). It says *some* and rides as one more thing that
//!   will not add, rather than being dropped: dropping it means coming home
//!   short.
//!
//! A row therefore carries between one and several [`Part`]s. One is the
//! ordinary case; more than one is the row that could not be added, and
//! ADR 0024's rule is that it says both rather than one wrong number.
//!
//! ## Where *about* goes, and where it does not
//!
//! **The mass and volume buckets always say *about*; the count, as-written and
//! no-amount buckets never do.** ADR 0016 makes *about* unconditional on the subordinate
//! line because Kamosu rounded, every time — and mass and volume are exactly
//! the buckets Kamosu converted and rounded. A count and a cook's own word
//! passed through untouched: `4 cloves` is four cloves, and saying *about four
//! cloves* would claim an arithmetic that never happened. ADR 0024 and #73 both
//! word it this way — "added together… saying *about*; side by side where they
//! do not".
//!
//! This is not the mark ADR 0015 warns about. *about* does not fire sometimes
//! within one kind of amount; it fires for exactly the kind of amount Kamosu
//! computed, always, and a row never shows the same amount both ways.
