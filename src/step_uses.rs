//! **Which Ingredient Lines a Step uses**, read out of the Step's own words
//! and the Readings beside it (ADR 0011, GLOSSARY.md "Step"). Nothing is stored
//! and nobody types a link (ADR 0019): this runs on every read of a Version.
//!
//! A recipe names an ingredient in full once, in its list, and shortens it
//! from then on. *Maple syrup* is *the syrup* by the second Step and *cacao en
//! poudre* is *le cacao*, so a Step that had to repeat the whole name linked
//! almost nothing (#184). Here a run of words inside the name counts, as
//! long as it holds a word a cook would call the food by
//! ([`reading::names_nothing_alone`] is the rest) and the name's main word,
//! the thing the Food is (#212): *vinegar* stands for *rice vinegar*, and
//! *rice* does not. Four rules then keep that looseness from linking what
//! the Step never adds:
//!
//! - **The longer mention wins.** *The vegetable oil* is one mention of the
//!   vegetable oil, not also one of the sesame oil's *oil*. A match on an
//!   ingredient's whole name always stands, as it did before #184.
//! - **One food on two lines links one of them.** Soy sauce in the filling and
//!   again in the dipping sauce: a Step naming it takes the first such line no
//!   earlier Step has used, or the first line again when every one is used.
//!   Two *different* foods sharing a short word (*sugar* with brown and white
//!   sugar) are both linked, and the cook picks. Both were chosen
//!   on #184.
//! - **What comes after *until* is not going in.** *Steam until most of the
//!   water has evaporated* adds no water, so a mention after *until*,
//!   *jusqu'à* or *hasta* counts for nothing up to the next comma or full
//!   stop, or the next thing to do: *until soft and add the garlic* adds the
//!   garlic (#294).
//! - **A word the title holds names the dish.** *Ladle the curry* in a
//!   *Vietnamese beef curry* serves the dish, not the curry powder, so a part
//!   of a name that the recipe's title also holds links nothing. The whole
//!   name still does: *add the garlic* in *Garlic bread* adds the garlic. The
//!   price, chosen on #357, is *add the lemon* in a *Lemon tart* no longer
//!   linking the lemon zest; a missing link leaves the line on screen, where a
//!   wrong one puts curry powder in the serving Step.
//!
//! Whole words only, as always: *rice* is never found in *price*, nor *ail* in
//! half the French language. One trailing `s` on a word is forgiven, so a line
//! read as *egg* is used by a Step that says *eggs*.
