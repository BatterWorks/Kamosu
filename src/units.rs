//! Units, scaling and conversion — ADR 0016, #49.
//!
//! **The set of Units is open; the set Kamosu can convert is closed.** Whatever
//! the cook wrote is a Unit and is kept exactly as written: *poignée*, *noix*,
//! *sachet* and *bottle* are all perfectly legitimate, and simply never offer a
//! conversion. Against that open set sits [`UNITS`], a closed list Kamosu knows
//! well enough to do arithmetic on, each knowing its own spellings in the three
//! interface Languages — so `g`, `gr`, `gramme`, `grammes` and `grams` are one
//! Unit and spelling is not a data-entry problem.
//!
//! **A conversion is never a rewrite.** Nothing here touches an Ingredient Line
//! (ADR 0002). What it produces is one subordinate line — *how much, for you,
//! right now* — which is absent whenever it would only repeat the line
//! unchanged.
//!
//! **Scaling and conversion are one act, so they get one slot.** Both answer
//! the same question, and given one line they never have to negotiate:
//! scaled-not-converted, converted-not-scaled and both look identical.
//!
//! ## The two arithmetic decisions worth knowing
//!
//! **Round last, once.** Scale, then convert, then round the number actually
//! shown. Rounding twice turns three cups into 720 ml when it is 710.
//!
//! **The cup is 236.588 ml, not 240.** ADR 0016 states both figures and they
//! agree: 236.588 is the arithmetic, 240 is what one cup *displays* as once the
//! ladder in [`round_to`] has run — and the ADR's own worked example ("three
//! cups is 710, not 720") only holds on 236.588. The same fall-out gives a
//! tablespoon 15 ml and a teaspoon 5 ml, exactly as the ADR's consequences say.
//! A tablespoon is a sixteenth of a cup and a teaspoon a third of that, so one
//! Cup Weight yields every volume measure of a Food by arithmetic.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No test seam. #49 requires all of this exercised through Operations, so the
//! tables below carry no unit tests of their own — `tests/behaviour.rs` drives
//! them through `get_recipe` against a real database, which is the only way to
//! prove both Doors got it.
