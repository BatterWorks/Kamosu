//! The cooking screen's two derivations, put through the real 86-recipe
//! Crouton export (#61, ADR 0011).
//!
//! ADR 0011's whole argument is a measured one — a cooking screen showing only
//! the instruction sends the cook back to the ingredient list, because 28% of
//! real Ingredient Lines carry no quantity and effectively none of the 599
//! Steps repeats one. The figures this test asserts are the other half of that
//! measurement, taken from the same export: **how many real Steps offer a
//! timer**, and that the reader never invents one out of a temperature, a
//! weight or an oven dial.
//!
//! Three invented steps prove nothing about a reader that has to face a French
//! *laisser reposer 1 heure* and an English *bake at 450F/230C for 20-30 min*
//! on the same afternoon, so every Step in the real export goes through the
//! real `create_recipe` and is read back through the real `get_recipe`.
//!
//! The export lives at `samples/crouton/` and is gitignored — personal, 110 MB,
//! and never committed (see `docs/research/crouton-real-export.md`). This test
//! is `#[ignore]`d so `just test` and CI never need it: run it deliberately
//! with `cargo test --test cooking_corpus -- --ignored` on a machine that has
//! the export.
