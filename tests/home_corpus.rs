//! Home's computed shelves, put through the real 86-recipe Crouton
//! export (#64).
//!
//! Three invented recipes prove nothing about a screen whose whole job is to
//! pick four handfuls out of a real library, so every recipe in the real
//! export is created through the real `create_recipe` Operation — **with the
//! times it actually carries** — and Home is then read back through
//! `home_shelves`.
//!
//! What it pins is the fact the *quick tonight* shelf lives or dies by: **36 of
//! the 86 recipes state no time at all**, and not one of them may be called
//! quick. A threshold measured against a library where seven recipes in ten
//! have a time would be a different threshold; asserting the real figure here
//! is what stops the shelf being tuned against an imagined library.
//!
//! The export lives at `samples/crouton/` and is gitignored — personal, 110 MB,
//! and never committed (see `docs/research/crouton-real-export.md`). This test
//! is `#[ignore]`d so `just test` and CI never need it: run it deliberately
//! with `cargo test --test home_corpus -- --ignored` on a machine that has the
//! export.
