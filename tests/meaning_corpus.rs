//! Meaning Search, put through the real 86-recipe Crouton export (#63).
//!
//! Three flattering examples prove nothing about a search that has to hold a
//! whole library, and a similarity threshold argued in the abstract is a number
//! somebody made up. So every recipe in the real export is created through the
//! real `create_recipe`, the real model is downloaded and the real index built,
//! and the searches below go through `search_recipes` at a real Door.
//!
//! What it asserts is what ADR 0027 and ADR 0029 promised: that meaning finds a
//! recipe words cannot, that an exact title still wins over anything the model
//! thinks, that a result quotes the line it matched on, and that *nothing
//! found* shows the closest anyway rather than an empty screen.
//!
//! The export lives at `samples/crouton/` and is gitignored — personal, 110 MB,
//! never committed. The model is a further ~220 MB fetched from Hugging Face.
//! So this is `#[ignore]`d and `just test` never needs either: run it
//! deliberately with `cargo test --test meaning_corpus -- --ignored` on a
//! machine that has the export and a network.
