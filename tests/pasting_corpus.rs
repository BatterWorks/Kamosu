//! Reading a pasted recipe, put through the real 86-recipe Crouton
//! export (#94).
//!
//! **This corpus is the only honest scoreboard the split has.** Crouton stored
//! each recipe's ingredients and steps as two separate lists, so writing them
//! out one after another rebuilds the paste a cook would have made from the
//! same page — and the correct boundary is already known, because it is where
//! one list stopped and the other started. Eighty recipes carry both.
//!
//! The paste is written the hard way on purpose: no blank line between the two
//! blocks, and no `Ingredients` or `Instructions` above either. A real paste
//! often carries those, and every one of them makes this easier. What is
//! measured here is the case with nothing to go on but the lines themselves.
//!
//! **The floors are floors, not targets.** They sit just under what was
//! measured on the day, so this fails on a regression and never on an
//! improvement. #94 set the bar at the 92% within one line that a throwaway
//! fifteen-line scorer reached without `reading.rs`.
//!
//! The export lives at `samples/crouton/` and is gitignored — personal, 110 MB,
//! and never committed (see `docs/research/crouton-real-export.md`). This test
//! is `#[ignore]`d so `just test` and CI never need it: run it deliberately
//! with `cargo test --test pasting_corpus -- --ignored` on a machine that has
//! the export.
