//! Reading Ingredient Lines, put through the real 86-recipe Crouton
//! export (#71, ADR 0036).
//!
//! **This corpus is the only honest scoreboard this feature has.** Ten
//! flattering lines prove nothing about a reader that has to survive a real
//! library — and this library is unusually good evidence, because Crouton
//! stored each line's amount, unit and name *separately*. Reassembling them
//! into the one written line a cook would type gives 863 real lines whose
//! correct answer is already known, which is what lets the floors below be
//! measured rather than asserted.
//!
//! Every recipe goes in through the real `create_recipe` Operation and every
//! Reading comes back through the real `get_recipe`, so what is scored is what
//! both Doors serve and not a function called directly.
//!
//! **The floors are floors, not targets.** They are set just under what was
//! measured on the day (ADR 0036: every amount, and every Unit the export
//! itself names), so this fails on a regression and never on an improvement.
//!
//! The export lives at `samples/crouton/` and is gitignored — personal,
//! 110 MB, and never committed (see `docs/research/crouton-real-export.md`).
//! This test is `#[ignore]`d so `just test` and CI never need it: run it
//! deliberately with `cargo test --test reading_corpus -- --ignored` on a
//! machine that has the export.
