<!--
	The things a person with nothing to look at was about to do anyway: write a
	recipe, or bring one in.

	It lives here rather than inside one screen because two screens reach the
	same dead end from different directions — Recipes, when a search matched
	nothing (#62, ADR 0027), and Home, when there is nothing on the shelf to
	suggest from (#64). Both are the same situation: you do not have it yet, and
	adding it was the next thing you were going to do.

	**Every offer *does* the thing rather than pointing at a screen to do it
	on.** That is the whole point of them: an offer that only navigates has put
	a screen between a person and the one act they came for — and on an empty
	instance it can put them on a second empty screen, which is worse than
	saying nothing.

	A recipe needs only a title (#6), so writing one is a title and a tap. Where
	the caller already knows the title — Recipes knows it, because you typed it
	into the search box — it passes it and the field disappears: asking for a
	word somebody has just finished typing is asking them to type it twice.

	**The acts themselves live in `$lib/adding`**, shared with the + beside the
	search box (#174), which offers the same three every day. This is only how
	the dead ends draw them: full-width buttons, since an empty screen should
	say what to do rather than point at a small button.
	**Nobody is asked where it goes.** A recipe you write goes into your own
	Cookbook, always (ADR 0041), so the tap writes it.
