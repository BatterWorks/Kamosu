<!--
	Test-only: `AddOrImport` takes its uploader from context, exactly as it
	takes its client, so a test hands the provider a stand-in for
	`POST /api/uploads` and no network is reached.

	`Arrived` is rendered beside it because the two are one behaviour split over
	a navigation: bringing a file in notes what happened, and that line is what
	shows it. In the app the layout draws `Arrived` above every screen (#93).
