<!--
	The one way anybody is asked to confirm something that cannot be undone
	(#103).

	It was written for the Operator's three acts and lived under `lib/operator/`
	until #120 gave a cook one of their own: deleting a recipe. It moved up here
	rather than being copied down, for the reason the next paragraph already
	gives — a second sheet is a second chance to word the frightening one
	carelessly, and the cook's is the most frightening of the four.

	Item 99 asks a Merge to say how many Ingredient Lines it is about to move
	before it moves them. The choice of 21 September 2026 took that pattern and
	gave it to the other two irreversible acts as well, so deleting an account
	and deleting a Food are asked in the same words and the same shape as a
	Merge. One component, because three confirmations written separately are
	three chances to word the frightening one carelessly.

	The count leads, in the largest type on the sheet, because the number is the
	thing a person is actually deciding about — "14 Ingredient Lines move" is a
	fact you can weigh, where "are you sure?" is not. `count` is optional: an act
	whose size is not a number (sweeping, standing somebody down) says its
	consequence in words alone rather than inventing a figure to look consistent.

	Deliberately NOT hold-to-confirm, which the mockup carried and the choice
	dropped: holding a button for a second is hard for anyone whose hands shake,
	and the sentence above it is doing the real work.
