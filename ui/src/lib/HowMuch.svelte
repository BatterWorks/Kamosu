<!--
	HOW MUCH ARE YOU MAKING (#109) — one picker, in two rooms.

	The cooking screen asks it before a fresh cooking starts, in the place the
	amounts and the Step will stand; the recipe page opens it under the
	ingredients' heading, for the errands. That shape was chosen on
	23 September 2026 from three built against the real corpus (option B on
	#109); the reasoning is there.

	− and + count in the recipe's own noun, one serving at a time. The four
	quick choices are ×½ · as written · ×2 · ×3, each labelled with what it comes
	to where it counts (`×2 · 24`). A recipe that never said what it makes —
	a third of the real library — has nothing to count from, so it gets the
	multipliers alone and a sentence saying why.

	It chooses and says nothing else. What a choice does to the amounts comes
	back from the Core (ADR 0016), and whoever holds this decides when to ask.
