<!--
	What Kamosu made of a pasted recipe, before anything is filled in (#94):
	the counts, the split drawn, and the split moveable.

	THE GUESS IS NEVER APPLIED SILENTLY. Measured on the real 86-recipe export,
	the boundary lands exactly on 77.5% of recipes and within one line on 95%.
	The 5% is why this exists at all: it names the counts, draws the split,
	and lets it be moved. A parser right four times in five and silent the
	fifth is worse than one that says so.

	Moving the split re-splits an answer already held. No line is read a second
	time and no request is made. It is off by one line on 95%, so the ordinary
	correction is one line (hence the two buttons) and the occasional one is a
	long way (hence every line being able to take the split itself).

	Two places draw it (#175): the writing screen's paste sheet, and the sheet
	the + on Recipes raises, for pasted text or a PDF (#176). Each says its own title line and its own buttons
	around it, because one fills a page and the other makes a recipe.
