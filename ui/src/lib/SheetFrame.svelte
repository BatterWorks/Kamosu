<!--
	The one frame every sheet in Kamosu is drawn in (#196, ADR 0044).

	On the phone layout it is a bottom sheet, as each of them was when it drew
	its own. On the wide layout it is a window in the middle of the room beside
	the rail, with the page dimmed and still readable behind it. That window
	was chosen on 5 October 2026 over one as wide as the page's column: 480
	wide, as tall as what it holds, centred both ways. Its measurements live in
	`sheet-window` in `app.css`.

	The frame owns what thirteen sheets each repeated, or forgot:

	- the dimmed page behind;
	- Escape, which closes it;
	- the caret, which moves in when it opens and goes back to what opened it
	  when it closes, so a keyboard user never loses their place on the page;
	- Enter, which confirms where the sheet says it has one clear confirm.

	What a sheet holds stays its own, and so does its padding and its colour,
	which it hands in as `class`.
