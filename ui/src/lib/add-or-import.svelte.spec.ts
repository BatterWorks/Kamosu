/**
 * Bringing a recipe in at the dead ends `AddOrImport` draws, at the screen
 * seam (#93, #174). The acts are `$lib/adding`'s, shared with the + beside the
 * search box, so these hold for both.
 *
 * The file itself travels out of band (ADR 0001), so the test stands in for
 * the upload and checks what happens around it: the id it answers is what
 * `import_bundle` is asked with, and the screen then opens the *recipe* rather
 * than the Import Report — which is the choice option C settled, and the whole
 * difference between one file and a Crouton library.
 *
 * Every Report used here is checked against the Catalogue's declared output by
 * the stand-in before the screen ever sees it, so these tests can lie about
 * values and cannot lie about shape.
