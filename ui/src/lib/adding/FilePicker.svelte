<!--
	The file field a Bundle (a Kamosu zip file) is chosen with, opened by a button
	somewhere else (#93), a recipe PDF (#176), or a photo of a page for
	Kamosu's AI agent (#278): one field per kind, since each offers the
	phone's picker only the files it can take. A phone offers its camera
	beside its photos for the last, as it does for any picture.

	A file cannot be chosen from a `<button>`, and the button has to be able to
	say offline what it is waiting for (#76) rather than fail when pressed. So
	the field is here, hidden, and whoever draws the button calls `open()`.

	**Kept out of the accessibility tree, not merely off the screen.** A file
	field maps to `role="button"` in Chromium, so an `sr-only` one beside the
	real button announced the same act twice and put a stop in the tab order
	that looked identical to the next one. Found on the dev instance with a
	screen-reader tree, 21 September 2026, not by any test. `display: none`
	costs nothing: a file picker opens from a programmatic `.click()` whether
	the field is drawn or not.

	The label stays because it is what says *which* field this is when anything
	does reach it, and it is how a screen test grips it.
