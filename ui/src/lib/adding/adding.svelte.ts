/**
 * The ways a new recipe starts, written once (#174): a web page, a Bundle
 * somebody sent you (a Kamosu zip file, ADR 0020), a title you type yourself,
 * a whole recipe pasted as text (#175), and a recipe PDF (#176).
 *
 * Two places offer them. The + beside the search box offers all three every
 * day, and the dead ends `AddOrImport` draws (a search that matched nothing,
 * an empty Home) offer them as full-width buttons. Each place holds its own
 * `Adding`, so one screen's work never quiets the other's buttons, but the acts
 * themselves live here and nowhere else. One act written twice is one act that
 * will eventually be two, which is how #93 moved the first two out of
 * `AddOrImport` and why #174 moved the third out after them.
 *
 * **Every act *does* the thing and ends on the recipe** (ADR 0027). A link and
 * a file are one recipe each and open it; a title *is* a recipe (#6), so
 * writing one opens it too. Nobody is asked where it goes: a recipe written or
 * brought in lands in its writer's own Cookbook (ADR 0041).
