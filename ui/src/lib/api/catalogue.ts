Another Cookbook here holding it is no part of the question: each Cookbook receives its own copy. Receiving makes nothing of your own — changing what arrived does.

Mints no Version and appears in no history (ADR 0021). All of them left out together clears the Reading, taking the line back to fully unread. The target is either a Food's written word or — as `lineage_id` — the Recipe this line names, which makes the Ingredient a Component (ADR 0008); never both, and a Lineage this instance does not hold is accepted, because a Component goes on naming its recipe when the recipe is gone. A save carries the Reading of each line left word for word as it was, in the same place, onto the new Version and never reads that line again, so this is how to correct a misreading without rewording the line.",
