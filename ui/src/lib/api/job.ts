 * in: a Job's row is the truth about it, and polling that row is how every
 * caller reads one, an agent at the MCP door included (ADR 0032).
 *
 * A Job that failed is raised as the error it is, so a caller writes one happy
 * path rather than checking a status by hand and forgetting the other two.
 *
 * `whileWaiting` is handed each poll's answer, so a caller that wants to show
 * how far the work has got reads the same row every other caller reads. Some
 * Jobs are long — downloading a model is hundreds of megabytes — so
 * `giveUpAfter` is the caller's to set rather than a constant that fits the
 * shortest one.
 *
 * Waiting past `giveUpAfter` throws `StillRunning`, which is not a failure.
 * The screens whose waits are short say so (#117); those that wait for hours
 * (the Import Report, Meaning Search, the Operator's Backups and line reading)
 * show its message as they show any other, and were deliberately left so.
 *
 * `stopped` lets a screen that has closed stop asking: the waiting ends with
 * the last answer read, and the Job itself carries on — only the reading of it
 * stops.
 *
 * `answersWhenFailed` returns a failed Job instead of raising it, for the one
 * caller that reads a failure as a result: an agent's Job that read a file is
 * its own Import, and ends failed with a Report saying why (#276).
 *
 * `answersWhenCancelled` returns a cancelled Job the same way, for that same
 * Import stopped by the cook: there is nothing wrong to say (#277).
