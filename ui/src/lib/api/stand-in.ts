/**
 * The screen-seam harness: a stand-in Kamosu, derived from the Catalogue.
 *
 * A screen test needs answers without a database behind them. The danger in
 * that is always the same — the stubbed answer drifts from what the real
 * Operation returns, the tests keep passing, and the kitchen breaks. Here it
 * cannot: the stand-in reads the *same* generated declarations the client is
 * built from, and every answer a test programs is checked against the output
 * schema the Catalogue declares before any screen sees it.
 *
 * So a test can lie about the values. It cannot lie about the shape.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const kamosu = standIn({ instance_status: { version: '0.1.0', setup_complete: true, password_minimum: 15, passkey_origin: null, demo: false } });
 * render(Home, { props: { kamosu: kamosu.client } });
 * ```
