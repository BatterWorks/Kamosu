/**
 * Sending a file too large for an Operation's envelope (ADR 0001).
 *
 * A Crouton library is 114 MB (#69). Carried as base64 inside a JSON body it
 * would be a third larger again and would sit whole in the Job's stored input,
 * so it travels as its own bytes to `POST /api/uploads` under the same
 * Credential, and the Operation that reads it is asked with the id this
 * answers.
 *
 * A screen takes the uploader from context, exactly as it takes its client
 * (`#lib/kamosu`) and its authentication (`#lib/auth`): the layout provides
 * the real one, a test provides a stand-in, and a screen never reaches the
 * network itself.
