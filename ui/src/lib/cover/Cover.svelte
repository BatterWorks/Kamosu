<!--
	A Cover: what leads a recipe with no Main Photo (#46; GLOSSARY.md, "Cover").

	No ADR governs this — the Cover is a vocabulary entry, not a decision with
	alternatives that had to be weighed. What it looks like was a
	choice, and the reasoning is recorded on issue #46 rather than here, since
	it is taste rather than architecture.

	Not a placeholder for a missing photograph — a recipe needs only a title,
	and 27 of the 86 recipes in the real corpus have no photograph at all. So
	this is drawn as something a recipe *has*, not as a gap where something
	should be.

	It carries the title itself, on the band at the hem. That is deliberate: a
	Cover with no words on it is a coloured rectangle, and the whole point is
	that a shelf of these is readable.

	What it looks like comes entirely from `coverFor`, which reads the Lineage
	id and nothing else. This component owns only how that is drawn. How the
	recipe *page* frames its hero is #81's decision, not this component's.

	Everything sizes in CSS rather than in pixels worked out here, so the same
	component serves a 282px hero and a 168px shelf tile without being told
	which it is.

<script lang="ts">
	import { coverFor } from './cover';

	interface Props {
		/** The recipe's Lineage id — the only thing the drawing is derived from. */
		lineageId: string;
		/** The recipe's title, set on the hem band. */
		title: string;
		/** Any CSS length. Defaults to the identity's recipe-hero height. */
		height?: string;
		/** The type utility for the title. A shelf card passes something smaller. */
		titleClass?: string;
		/**
		 * Whether to draw the hem band carrying the title.
		 *
		 * The band exists so a *shelf* of Covers is readable — a Cover with no
		 * words on it is a coloured rectangle. Leading a recipe page it has the
		 * opposite effect: the title is set in full immediately beneath it, so
		 * the band prints it twice (#81). A page hero passes false; a shelf
		 * tile, and anything else showing a Cover on its own, keeps it.
