/**
 * The Cover: what leads a recipe that has no Main Photo (#46).
 *
 * A Cover is a dyed ground carrying one large pasta shape, with a solid band
 * at the hem holding the recipe's title. Everything about how it looks —
 * which dye, which shape, how big, how turned, where placed — is derived from
 * the recipe's **Lineage id and nothing else**.
 *
 * That single rule is what the ticket's guarantees rest on:
 *
 * - a rename never changes a recipe's face, because the title is not an input;
 * - a Translation wears its source's face, because a Translation is a Branch
 *   of the same Lineage (ADR 0006) and Branch ids are not an input;
 * - the same Lineage wears the same face on every instance it reaches, because
 *   there is no per-instance state here at all.
 *
 * A Cover is generated at the moment of drawing. It is never stored as a
 * Photograph, is in no fingerprint and travels in no Bundle — there is nothing
 * to store, because this file *is* the Cover.
 *
 * Chosen on 2026-08-28 after four rounds of options; the reasoning
 * is recorded on issue #46.

 * Order is part of the contract, exactly as it is for the shapes: a Cover is
 * chosen by index, so reordering this list repaints every existing recipe.
