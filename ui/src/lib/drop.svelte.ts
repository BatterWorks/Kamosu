/**
 * Files and links dropped onto Kamosu (ADR 0044, #204).
 *
 * A drop is taken only where it has one meaning: a PDF, a Bundle or a web
 * link onto Recipes, a photograph onto the photograph it would set, a
 * Crouton export onto its import (#205). Three things live here, and every
 * place that takes a drop is built from them:
 *
 * - `DropZone` follows a drag over one place, says what it carries while it
 *   is there, and hands over what was let go.
 * - `FilePlace` is a zone that takes one file of one kind, which is all a
 *   photograph's place or the Crouton import is.
 * - `keepDropsOut` is the rest of the app. A browser shown a dropped file
 *   opens it in place of the page, and a dropped link is followed, so
 *   anywhere no zone took the drop it is turned away and Kamosu stays.
 *
 * **Before it is let go a browser says only what kind of thing is carried**:
 * that there are files and each one's type, or that there is a link. The
 * file's name and the link's address arrive with the drop. A type can be
 * empty, where the computer knows no type for the file, so a zone decides
 * again once it holds the file.
 *
 * A drag that began inside Kamosu is none of this, and is left alone: a
 * recipe's card pulled across the shelf carries a link too.
