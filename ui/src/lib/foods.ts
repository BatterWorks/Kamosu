 * Kitchen's, which is why every Operation that reads or corrects one is
 * `Permission::Person` and none of them takes a Kitchen.

 * **This list is the Catalogue's, not this file's.** It is derived from the

 * the frontend and the Core cannot disagree about an Operation's shape
 * (AGENTS.md, "The interface"). A self-hoster adding a fourth Language to
 * `src/catalogue.rs` regenerates the client and finds this list grew with it,
 * where a hand-written copy would have gone quietly stale with nothing going

 * decides whether two words name the same Food. A search box wants the
 * opposite: somebody typing `pecan` on a phone keyboard means `noix de pécan`,
 * and refusing to find it would be pedantry.
 *
