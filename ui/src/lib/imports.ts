 * is drawn on the source list's card and on the source's own screen, and a
 * count worded two different ways would read as two different facts.
 *
 * **A source kind is not a closed set.** Three importers name their own —
 * `crouton`, `bundle`, `web` — but the general `import` Operation takes
 * whatever an agent passes, and its ledger is as real as theirs. Paraglide
 * compiles every phrase to a function, so an unknown kind has no phrase to
 * name it: it falls back to a frame that holds the raw word. That is honest
 * where inventing a friendly name would not be.
