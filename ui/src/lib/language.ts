/**
 * A Language, said in words (ADR 0006, #106).
 *
 * A Language reaches a screen as a code — `en`, `fr`, `nl`, or `unknown` — and
 * no screen may print one. "In fr" is not a sentence, and a code read aloud by
 * a screen reader is worse than one looked at.
 *
 * This is the single mapping from code to word. `matched.ts` held the first
 * copy, for the shelf's fallback mark, and its own comment says why there must
 * never be a second: that is how "In French" becomes "In fr" on one screen and
 * nobody notices. It now reads this one.
 *
 * **THE TWO LISTS BELOW ARE THE CATALOGUE'S, NOT THIS FILE'S.** They are
 * derived from the generated client rather than typed out again, because the
 * client is generated from the Catalogue precisely so the frontend and the
 * Core cannot disagree about an Operation's shape (AGENTS.md, "The
 * interface"). A self-hoster adding a Language to `src/catalogue.rs`
 * regenerates the client, and a hand-written copy here would go quietly stale
 * with nothing going red. `LANGUAGE_WORDS` below is the one place that then
 * fails to compile, which is the right place to be told.
 *
 * The two differ by exactly one member, and that difference is the Core's rule
 * rather than this file's opinion: a recipe may carry Unknown, but a
 * Translation may never be written into it — a recipe honestly written in two
 * Languages can neither be a Translation nor have one.
