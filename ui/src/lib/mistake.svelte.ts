/**
 * When Kamosu itself goes wrong (#98, option C, chosen 22 September 2026).
 *
 * Every screen draws one line: a **refusal** the Core meant to send is an
 * `OperationError`, caught and said on screen (ADR 0040); anything else is a
 * **mistake** in Kamosu, re-thrown rather than dressed up as a polite refusal.
 * The line was always right. What was missing is this — something underneath to
 * catch what is thrown across it, so a mistake reaches the cook instead of a
 * console nobody has open.
 *
 * Three layers reach here, because no one of them sees what the others do:
 *
 * 1. `createClient` catches a mistake escaping any Operation call. This is the
 *    screen seam, so a test can raise a real `Error` from behind a stand-in and
 *    assert what the cook is shown.
 * 2. The root layout's `<svelte:boundary>` catches a mistake made while
 *    rendering or in an effect, which no promise ever sees.
 * 3. `watchForMistakes` nets the rest: a mistake in a screen's own code after
 *    the await, which rejects into nowhere because Svelte awaits neither an
 *    event handler's promise nor a fire-and-forget `$effect`.
 *
 * **Layer 3 cannot be tested here, because jsdom never fires
 * `unhandledrejection`** — probed directly rather than assumed. It is verified
 * in a real browser instead, and that one fact is why the other two layers
 * exist rather than one net over everything.
 *
 * A mistake more than one layer sees is said once.
