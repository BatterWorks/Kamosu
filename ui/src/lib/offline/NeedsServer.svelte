<!--
	A button for something only the server can do (#76, ADR 0013).

	Editing a recipe, keeping an As Cooked as a Version and taking a Copy are on
	the recipe's side of the line, and none of them is ever queued: an offline
	edit queue is a merge, and Kamosu never merges. So offline the button stays
	where it is, greyed, and its words change to say what it is waiting for —
	"Editing waits for the server" — rather than failing when pressed (option C,
	chosen 19 September 2026).

	Edit (#83) and Take a Copy (#65) are drawn with this when they arrive, with
	`offline_waits_edit` and `offline_waits_copy`.
