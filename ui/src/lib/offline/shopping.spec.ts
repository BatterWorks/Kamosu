/**
 * The phone adds a Shopping List up exactly as the server does (#77).
 *
 * Every case here was written by `shopping_parity` in `src/shopping.rs`, with
 * the server's own answer beside it. If this fails, the phone's copy of the
 * sum in `shopping.ts` says something the server does not — or the server's
 * sum changed and this copy has not caught up. Either way the fix is here, not
 * in the file: the file is the server speaking.
