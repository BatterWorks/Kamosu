/**
 * Does this Person administer the instance? (#103)
 *
 * Kamosu has no Operation answering *who is signed in* — `rename_person`
 * writes a name and nothing reads one back — so the question is put the only
 * way it can be: by asking something only an Operator may ask and seeing
 * whether the Core allows it. `list_accounts` is the cheapest of those, and it
 * is the Operator screen's first call anyway, so asking costs that screen
 * nothing.
 *
 * Written once because two screens ask it — Settings, to decide whether to
 * show the way in, and the Operator screen itself — and written twice it would
 * be two subtly different askings. It already was: both call sites treated
 * *any* refusal as "not an Operator", so an unreadable database showed a real
 * Operator an empty room and hid their own door. Three answers, not two, is
 * the fix, and it belongs in one place.
