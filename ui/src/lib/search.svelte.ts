/**
 * Searching the shelf as you type (#121).
 *
 * Three screens have a search box over `search_recipes`: the shelf, the
 * Component picker and the Related Recipes sheet. Each needs the same three
 * things, and this is the one place they are written:
 *
 * 1. wait a moment after the last keystroke, so typing *curry* asks once
 *    rather than five times;
 * 2. ask `search_recipes`, the one Operation — Meaning Search arrived inside
 *    it rather than beside it (ADR 0029), so every box finds what the shelf
 *    finds for the same words;
 * 3. drop an answer if something newer has been asked since, so a slow reply
 *    cannot land on top of a fresher one.
 *
 * What each screen searches for stays its own: the shelf has filters and the
 * pickers have none (#62). A screen says that in `ask`, and nothing else.
 *
 * `ask` IS CALLED INSIDE THE EFFECT, BEFORE THE DELAY, and that is the whole
 * of what makes this work. Svelte re-asks only when a value it saw read
 * changes; read the search box inside the timer instead and the box goes on
 * working on first open, then silently stops following the thumb. The screen
 * tests type into the real boxes for exactly that reason.
