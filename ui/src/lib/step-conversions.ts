/**
 * A Step's text, cut where each conversion goes (#150).
 *
 * The Core answers each conversion a Step offers as `{ written, measured }`:
 * the oven temperature, or the amount and Unit, exactly as the text has them,
 * and what they come to for this reader. Each addition goes straight after
 * what it converts, "1 lb. (about 455 g) ground chicken" and "preheat to 425°
 * (about 220 °C)": option A, chosen on 25 September 2026 over one
 * line of figures beneath the Step.
 *
 * Found by searching forward from the last one, so two `2 Tbsp.` in one Step
 * land on the first and the second in turn. One not found (the cook rewrote
 * the words) is left out rather than put somewhere it does not belong.
 * The text itself is never changed: joining each piece's `text` and `written`
 * gives it back.
