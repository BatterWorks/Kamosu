/**
 * How a Tag's word is drawn, in one place (#104).
 *
 * Four screens show a Tag — the row on a recipe, the sheet that puts one on,
 * the shelf's filter and the Settings list — and every one of them needs the
 * same two facts: which word to print, and whether to mark it as being in a
 * Language the reader did not ask for. Written once here because the four had
 * drifted into three functions and one inlined copy of the same idea, and
 * because the version they had drifted into was wrong.
 *
 * **Neither fact is decided here.** The Core chooses the word, against the
 * Reading Language held on the account, and says whether it fell back
 * (`language_fallback`, the same word a shelf entry uses). A screen that
 * compared `tag.language` against the *interface* locale — which is what these
 * four did before — marks every Tag wrongly for anybody reading Kamosu in one
 * Language and their recipes in another, and those are two separate settings.
