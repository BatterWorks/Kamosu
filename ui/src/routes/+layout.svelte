					     Not on the cooking screen, for the same reason as everything else

					     `fixed inset-0 z-30`, so a card in ordinary flow is painted
					     underneath it, unseen by the cook while a screen reader still
					     announces the alert. The cooking screen says it in two words of its
					     own instead, on the row it already has, and opens this card only on
					     a tap (#119, option B, chosen 23 September 2026). The mistake is

					The screen itself, walled off (#98). A mistake made while rendering, or

					that sees it, and without one it tears down the whole app, the card
					included, so the one surface meant to report the mistake would go with it.

					The boundary sits INSIDE main and the card outside it, which is what keeps
					that from happening: the screen is what is walled off, and the card is
					what survives to say so. A handled boundary drops its content, so the
					half-drawn screen goes rather than sitting there looking like it is still
					loading — which is the whole complaint this issue was filed about.
