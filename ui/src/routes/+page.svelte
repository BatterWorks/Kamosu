<!--
	`/` — **Home** to a Person, and the account form to anyone who is not one yet.

	The tab bar has pointed Home at `/` since the shell was built, and until now
	`/` was the login form. This is the other side of signing in (#64).

	**How it knows: it asks.** There is no cookie read here and no second idea of
	who is signed in kept beside the Core's — the screen asks for its shelves,
	and a refusal *is* the answer that nobody is signed in. One round trip does
	both jobs, so a signed-in Person never sees the login form flash first.

	An Invite or a recovery link opens a route of its own, not this one (#126).
