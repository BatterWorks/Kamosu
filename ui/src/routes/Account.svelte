<!--
	Becoming, or returning as, a Person: setup, login, an Invite and a recovery
	link, all four wearing the same form (#38).

	It is not a route of its own. `/` is **Home** once you are signed in, and
	this is what stands there until you are — so the one address in the tab bar
	is the one address you are ever sent to, whichever side of signing in you
	are on.

	An Invite or a recovery link is the exception: each opens a route of its own
	(`/invite/<secret>`, `/recover/<secret>`), which hands the link down as
	`link` and goes Home once this form has signed in (#126).
