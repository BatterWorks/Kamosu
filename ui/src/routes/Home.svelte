<!--
	Home: the computed shelves that answer *show me something* (#64, ADR 0011,
	ADR 0027).

	The first screen is a suggestion rather than a search box. Everything on it
	is worked out from recipes and cookings that already exist — *Recipes* is
	where you go when you know what you are looking for, and this is where you
	go when you do not.

	**The arrangement was chosen on 2026-08-30 from four full-screen
	options drawn over the real 86-recipe library; the reasoning is on #64.** It
	takes the labelled section from one option and the sideways rail from
	another. What the choice settles:

	- **A shelf is a section**, headed the way every other section in the app is
	  headed, with the count beside it linking into the library. Home is the
	  library's own furniture rather than a second visual system next to it.
	- **A section carries a rail, not a grid.** The card at the right edge is
	  cut in half on purpose: a peeking card is the only thing that says *there
	  is more this way* without a control saying it, and it is what puts two
	  whole shelves above the fold and all four within one flick.

	The cards themselves are #62's, unchanged — `Tile`, the same component the
	library's shelf draws, taking the same shape the same Operation family
	answers in. A recipe is one object across both screens, not two treatments
	of one.

	**Which shelves exist is the Core's answer, never this screen's.** An empty
	shelf never arrives, so there is no case here where a heading has to decide
	whether to draw itself — and an instance with nothing on its shelf sends no
	shelves at all, which is what lets the empty state be said once instead of
	five times.

					The gutter is padding on the rail rather than on the page, so the

					pushed clear of the right edge. Snap points mean a flick lands on
					a card rather than between two.

					`scroll-pl-gutter` is what keeps that alignment true: a snap point
					is measured from the scroller's edge, not from its padding, so
					without it the rail silently scrolls the gutter away at rest and
					the first card sits flush against the side of the phone while its
					own heading is still indented.

					On the wide layout the rail runs to the window's right edge
					(#201), and the cards keep the phone's width: an iPad on its
					side then shows two whole shelves before scrolling, where
					wider cards showed one and a half.
