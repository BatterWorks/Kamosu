<!--
	The cooking screen: ONE Step filling the phone, with the amounts for that
	step above it (ADR 0011).

	It is used at arm's length, with wet hands, on a phone propped against
	something — which is the whole of why it is shaped like this:

	  · the Step's text is the LARGEST TYPE IN THE APP (`text-step`, 26px), and
	    it is the only thing on screen that scrolls;
	  · above it, ONLY the Ingredients this step uses. Not the list, not a
	    filter over the list — the two or three lines that matter now, on the
	    room's own ground with a hairline under them. A step that adds nothing
	    says so in words rather than showing an empty box;
	  · the ground turns indigo. Standing at the stove is another room, and it
	    is the one place in Kamosu where that is true;
	  · THERE IS NO TAB BAR HERE. The layout hides it on this route, so no tap
	    near the bottom of a wet phone can land you in Shopping. The foot of
	    the screen is Back and Next and NOTHING ELSE (#88), so the only thing a
	    wet thumb can reach there is a way through the recipe.

	HOW MUCH ROOM ANY OF IT GETS WAS SETTLED BY MEASUREMENT, NOT BY EYE (#88).
	The screen is used in Safari with its URL bar on show, which leaves about
	700px on the phone this was fitted to — not the 844px a headless browser
	reports. Everything about this room's spacing was re-fitted against the real
	579 Steps of the Crouton export at that height: 53% of Steps naming two
	amounts used to fit without scrolling, and 92% do now. Before moving a
	number here, measure it at 700px against real Steps.

	EVERY CONTROL A WET THUMB MUST HIT IS 48px OF TOUCH. Some of them are only
	32px of ink — `tap-out` grows the hit box with a pseudo-element instead of
	with height, because a row this screen does not need is a line of the Step.

	WHICH INGREDIENTS THIS STEP USES IS NOT DECIDED HERE. The Core works it out
	from their Readings and serves it as `version.cooking.steps[i].uses` — a
	list of indices into the recipe's own Ingredient Lines — so an agent at the
	MCP door asked to read out the next step names the same amounts this screen
	is showing (ADR 0001). The same is true of the duration a timer is offered
	for and of the Step's conversions, its oven and its amounts: all are read out
	of the Step's own text, server-side, at display time, and none is stored.

	THE AMOUNTS ARE THE WRITTEN LINES, at full size, with the one subordinate
	line beneath them (#49, ADR 0016) — already converted to this cook's
	measures, because `get_recipe` works `measured` out for this reader. A line
	Kamosu could not read carries no subordinate line and is shown whole rather
	than guessed at (ADR 0002); at the Yield as written nothing marks it as
	unread, because a badge that fires sometimes teaches people it fires always.

	HOW MUCH IS BEING COOKED IS ASKED BEFORE A FRESH COOKING STARTS (#109, option
	B, the choice of 23 September 2026). The question stands where the
	amounts and the Step will, and the foot's own right-hand button starts the
	cooking — there is no second button for it. Afterwards the Yield on the row
	above the hairline brings the question back, and the foot then reads *Back
	to step N*. Once the amounts are scaled THE SCALED AMOUNT LEADS: the Core's
	subordinate line at full size, the recipe's own line small beneath it. At
	the stove the number to measure is the one that matters, and the written
	line is still there to say what it is a number of. A line that could not be
	scaled keeps its own words and says it was not scaled — once a cook has
	asked for twice the recipe, a line left alone is exactly what they need
	telling. Kamosu scaled nothing here: every figure came from the Core.

			being thrown away, so it asks first. FINISH COOKING is at the foot, with
			the step it ends on.

			It WRAPS rather than truncating. In English and French the row fits; in
			Spanish `No estoy cocinando` and `La pantalla puede apagarse` are 44
			characters between them and take a second line. A screen that silently
			clipped `La pantalla puede apagar…` would be worse than one that is a row

			THE ROW ABOVE THE HAIRLINE, which exists whatever is on it, and is why

			THE TIMER LIVES HERE NOW. It used to sit under the Step, inside the
			Step's own scrolling column — so on a long Step a RUNNING timer
			scrolled out of sight, which is the one thing a timer must never do.
			Up here it is always visible, and it costs the room no height at all,
			because the row was already being paid for by `Changed it`.

			32px of ink over a 48px tap area, both of them: `tap-out` grows the
			hit box with a pseudo-element rather than with height, so a control a
			wet thumb must be able to hit does not spend a whole row saying one
			word. THE GAPS AROUND THEM ARE WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE — the overhang is
			8px on every side and invisible, and it wins any hit test it covers.
			`gap-6` leaves 8px of clearance between the two; `pt-3` above and the
			hairline's `mt-3` below leave 4px each. Narrow any of them and this
			row starts stealing taps from its neighbours in silence.
