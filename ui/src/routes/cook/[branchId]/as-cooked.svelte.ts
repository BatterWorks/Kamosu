/**
 * The **As Cooked** a cook builds at the stove (#58, ADR 0005).
 *
 * What this module holds is a whole recipe, never a list of differences. The
 * Attempt stores one only where the cooking actually differed, and the Core
 * decides that by fingerprint rather than trusting anything here — so a screen
 * that sends the recipe back untouched stores nothing at all.
 *
 * **Why a row carries `from`.** The cooking screen navigates by index: which
 * Step you are on, and which Ingredient Lines that Step uses, are indices into
 * the *Version being cooked*. The moment a cook drops a line or inserts a step,
 * a plain array stops lining up with those indices — `uses: [2]` would start
 * naming a different ingredient. Each row therefore remembers where it came
 * from in the Version, or says it came from nowhere because the cook wrote it.
 * Everything the screen looks up goes through `from`, and nothing goes through
 * an array position.
 *
 * **Why a dropped line is kept.** It stays in the list, marked, so a cook can
 * put it back with the same tap that took it out — nothing vanishes from under
 * a wet finger. It is simply left out when the recipe is serialised.
 *
 * **Nothing here pairs anything** (ADR 0019). Rebuilding this from an As
 * Cooked already stored uses the Core's own reading of it — the same Pairing
 * two Branches are laid over each other with, served on the Attempt. A frontend
 * matching lines by position would be wrong exactly when it matters.
