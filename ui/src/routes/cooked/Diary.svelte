<!--
	Cooked: the cooking diary (#60).

	Your Attempts sorted by date rather than by recipe, which is the whole of
	why this screen exists — *what did I cook that week* is a question the shelf
	cannot answer however it is filtered, because the shelf is filed by dish.
	So the headings here are months, and a recipe cooked four times appears
	four times.

	**Cookings nobody ever finished are in it**, marked and never hidden — see
	the mark itself, below, for why there is exactly one mark and not two.

	Everything here is one person's own. `list_attempts` is scoped to its
	caller in the Core, so there is no filter on this screen to get wrong and
	nothing to say about whose diary it is: it is yours, and there is no other.
