<!--
	The Foods: every edible thing Kamosu learnt by itself, and the way to one (#107).

	**Why a screen exists at all.** A Food is the most numerous thing Kamosu
	knows — 607 on the dev instance — and until this ticket it was the only one
	with no screen. Four of the five Operations that read and correct a Food had
	no caller anywhere in the interface, so a Cup Weight could never be supplied
	and a Food could never be given its name in a second Language. Both were
	designed to matter and both were unreachable.

	**This list is a way THROUGH, not a thing to read.** Nobody browses 607 rows
	for pleasure, so the search field is the screen and the list under it is the
	result. It opens showing the Foods the most lines point at, because those are
	the ones where correcting anything changes the most.

	**It answers to any of a Food's names.** Searching `sel` finds the Food called
	`salt` where somebody has taught it both, which is the whole mechanism ADR
	0006 built naming-per-Language for. Matching is done here on the plain folded
	word rather than asked of the Core, because `list_foods` already carries every
	name and a round trip per keystroke would be slower and no more correct.

	**`?q=` is how the Reading corrector arrives.** A Reading carries the written
	word and never a Food's id — deliberately, since a Food is instance-local and
	an id would mean nothing in a Bundle (see `reading_schema` in the Catalogue).
	So the corrector hands over the word and this screen resolves it. Where two
	Foods answer to one word, which ADR 0022 permits, both are shown rather than
	one being guessed at: the duplicate is the thing worth seeing.

	**On the wide layout this is the list beside the open Food** (#199, ADR
	0044), drawn by `Foods.svelte`. It is 300 wide and stays where it is while
	one Food after another is opened: its title and search box at the top, its
	rows scrolling under them. A row there is the name with the number of lines
	at its right, and the open Food's row is marked. This was chosen on 6
	October 2026 over the rows the phone has, which need a list 420 wide.

	**The arrows walk it.** Up and down open the Food above or below the open
	one, in place of it: the history entry is replaced, so going back leaves
	the list in one step. A click on a row is an ordinary link and adds an
	entry. Tab reaches one row of the list and no more, and the caret stays on
	a row that was clicked or walked to, so the open Food is one Tab from its
	row.
