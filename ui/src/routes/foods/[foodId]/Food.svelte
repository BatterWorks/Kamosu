<!--
	One Food: what it is called, what a cup of it weighs, and how much it matters (#107).

	Chosen on 22 September 2026 from three designs drawn at a phone
	viewport — a Food is a page, reached two ways: from the Ingredient Line that
	named it, and from the Foods list in Settings. The alternative designs put
	the whole of this inside the Reading corrector, or only in Settings; the
	first cannot reach a Food no recipe in front of you names, and the second is
	a screen away from the moment somebody is holding the bag.

	**NOTHING HERE IS RECIPE CONTENT (ADR 0002).** A Food is Kamosu's
	understanding of an Ingredient Line, never the line itself. Correcting one
	writes no Version, changes no written line and appears in no Thread — which
	is said on the page rather than merely being true, because a screen that
	quietly edits recipes and a screen that quietly does not look identical.

	**THE READING COUNT IS THE HONEST MEASURE.** `get_food` answers how many
	Readings point at this Food, and that is the only fact on the page that says
	whether correcting it is worth anything. A Food nothing points at is a Food
	nobody will notice you fixed.

	**A NAME PER LANGUAGE IS NOT A TRANSLATION OF ANYTHING** (ADR 0006). Teaching
	the Food called `flour` that it is also `farine` is what puts both on one
	shopping-list line. It says nothing about any recipe's Language, and the page
	says so, because "add French" on a screen full of English otherwise reads as
	an offer to translate a recipe.

	**SEVERAL NAMES IN ONE LANGUAGE ARE ONE ROW** (#179, option B, chosen on
	27 September 2026 over a row per name). A Food may answer to
	"œufs" and "œuf", and a line naming either reads as it. The row shows them
	joined "œufs · œuf", as the Foods list already does, and Change opens a box
	per name with Take off beside it, an empty box for another, and one Save for
	the Language. The first name is the one lists show, and the editor says so.

	**THE LAST NAME CANNOT BE TAKEN OFF.** A Food is known by its words alone, so
	the Core refuses `set_food_names` when it would leave none. The refusal is
	worded here as a sentence and Take off is simply absent on a Food's only
	name — a button that exists to explain why it does not work is worse than no
	button. The Core's refusal is still shown verbatim if it ever arrives, since
	it is written to be read.

	**WHAT IS NOT HERE.** No nutrition editor: #72 made nutrition a manual
	per-recipe field and deferred per-ingredient data, and all 607 Foods answer
	`nutrition: null` correctly. No merge, no delete, no merge preview: those are
	the Operator's and live on the Operator's screen (#103).

	**ON THE WIDE LAYOUT IT IS A CARD BESIDE THE FOODS LIST** (#199, ADR 0044),
	and one Food follows another there without the page being left. The Food on
	screen stays until the next has been read, so walking the list with the
	arrows does not blink "Loading" between every two. Nothing can be saved in
	that moment, since what is on screen is no longer the Food the address
	names.
