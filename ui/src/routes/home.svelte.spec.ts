/**
 * The screen-seam test: Home, against a stand-in Kamosu (#64).
 *
 * The stand-in checks every answer below against the shape the Catalogue
 * declares before the screen sees it, so a test here can lie about the values
 * and never about the shape — rename a field in `src/catalogue.rs` and this
 * fails in the same commit.
 *
 * What it is really for is the part a behaviour test cannot reach, because
 * none of it is an Operation's answer: that `/` is Home to a Person and the
 * login form to anybody else, that an omitted shelf leaves no heading behind,
 * that the shelf which says *under 30 minutes* takes the 30 from the Core
 * rather than from a phrase file, and that a brand-new instance is told what to
 * do rather than shown four empty rows.
