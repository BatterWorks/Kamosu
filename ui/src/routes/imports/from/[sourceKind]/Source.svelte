<!--
	One source, and everything that ever arrived through it (#108).

	**The URL is `/imports/from/<kind>` and not `/imports/<kind>`** because
	`/imports/<jobId>` is the Report and has been since #68. A source screen
	under the same segment would be a source called `j_578dfd…`.

	**This is where forgetting lives, and the only place.** `forget_import`
	throws away a whole channel's ledger — on the dev instance, all 89 Crouton
	recipes at once, across three separate runs — and cannot throw away one
	arrival. A screen about exactly one source is where that scope reads
	correctly; a link in a list of everything would not say which "these" it
	meant.

	**The asking is `Confirm`, the one sheet every irreversible act in Kamosu
	uses** (#103, #120). Its shape happens to be exactly what this act needs:
	the count leads in the largest type on the sheet, and here the count is the
	reassuring fact rather than the frightening one — *89 recipes stay exactly
	as they are*. The cost follows behind the red rule, because it is invisible
	until the next time the same file is brought in and so has to be spelt out
	rather than felt. `cancelLabel` is this ticket's one addition to that
	component: forgetting has a named opposite, *Keep the memory*, where
	deleting an account has only Cancel.

	**Forgetting does not empty this screen.** The ledger goes; the Jobs never do
	(`jobs` rows are terminal, never deleted), so the arrivals and their Reports
	stay listed with `import_id` null. Hiding them would recreate the exact
	unreachability this ticket closes.
