/**
 * One source and its arrivals, with forgetting (#108).
 *
 * The forget confirmation is the part worth being careful about. `forget_import`
 * reads as destructive and is not: no recipe is deleted, renamed or marked
 * (ADR 0025). Its real cost is invisible until the next time the same file is
 * brought in. So what is tested is that the sheet says both — what is kept and
 * what is lost — before anything happens, that nothing is asked of the Core
 * until the sheet is answered, and that answering it does not take the arrivals
 * away with the ledger.
