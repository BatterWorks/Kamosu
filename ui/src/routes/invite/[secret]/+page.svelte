<!--
	`/invite/<secret>` — the page an Invite link opens: the story first (#158),
	then the account form in its Invite mode, and Home once it has made the
	account (#126). The story's last button is the way to the form; Skip reaches
	that button from any stage. An Invite that makes an Operator reads the same.

	Whether the Invite is still good is learned by using it. A spent, revoked or
	unknown one is refused when the form is sent, in the Core's own words.

	The secret arrives as the `params` prop rather than off `$app/state`, which
	every other route reads. That is so a test can render this page itself, with
	a secret of its choosing (`LinkTestHarness`): what went missing in #126 was
	the route, not the form, so the route is what the test has to hold.
