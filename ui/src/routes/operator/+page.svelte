<!--
	The Operator's screen (#103).

	Kamosu had eighteen Operator-only Operations and a screen for one of them.
	Everything else — inviting the person you live with, taking a Backup, joining
	two Foods that are one thing — was reachable only through `curl`, an agent at
	the MCP door, or the terminal. This is the door.

	**Two rooms**, chosen 21 September 2026 from three designs drawn at a phone
	viewport. The Worklist holds what accumulates and wants working through; the
	Instance holds what merely sits there. The ticket raised the doubt itself —
	Merge Suggestions is evidence that piles up, which is a different rhythm from
	a settings toggle — and this takes it at its word rather than wedging a
	worklist between Backups and an address.

	**ADR 0007 draws the line this screen must not cross.** The Operator
	administers and does not read: no view-as-user, no support mode, no window
	onto another Person's recipes or Attempts. That is kept by `list_accounts`
	answering no question about a recipe, an Attempt or a Kitchen — the boundary
	lives in the Core, not in this screen's restraint — and it is said out loud
	here rather than merely observed, because a courtesy nobody mentions reads as
	a wall that is not there.

	**Nothing here is visible to a Person who is not an Operator.** The screen
	asks `list_accounts` and, refused, shows what a room that is not here shows
	(ADR 0040). It does not render an explanation of what it would have held.
