<!--
	A recipe dropped onto Recipes (ADR 0044, #204): a PDF, a Kamosu zip file
	(a Bundle, ADR 0020), or a link dragged from another tab. Each is the act
	its row under the + is, run on the + 's own `adding`, so a drop can do
	nothing a button could not, and no drop is the only way to do anything.

	The whole window is the place while Recipes is on screen. The sidebar is
	part of it: somebody aiming at the page and landing an inch to the left
	meant the same thing. So is the search box, which is under the cover with
	everything else by the time anything can be let go.

	**While something is held over it the page is covered** by a sheet of the
	paper with a dashed frame, and words in the middle say what letting go
	will do (`$lib/DropCover`). This was chosen on 7 October 2026 from two options drawn over
	the real Recipes screen (option 1, recorded on #204), over a bar across
	the top that left the recipes in view. Something Recipes cannot take turns
	it the alert colour and says so before it is let go.

	A browser says what kind of file is carried and keeps its name until the
	drop (`$lib/drop`), so the words name a PDF where the type says PDF and
	ask only for "a recipe" where the type is empty. What was dropped is
	judged again by its name once it is here.

	More than one file is refused like anything else that is no recipe: every
	row under the + takes one.

	**Not while a sheet is open over the page**, the one a PDF is checked on
	included, and not while an act is running. A drop then is turned away
	like one on any other screen.
