<!--
	The one place Meaning Search is offered (#63, ADR 0029).

	Not in settings. A settings screen is where features go to be undiscovered,
	and this is the moment a person can see exactly what they are missing: they
	looked for something, and words did not find it. So the offer is carried
	once, here, where it is earned.

	It is only ever shown to somebody who can act on it — the Operation decides
	that, not this component — and never again to an Operator who said no. An
	answered question asked twice is a nag.

	Turning it on is three Operations in a row: accept the terms, fetch the
	model, read the library. The middle two are Jobs, watched through `get_job`
	like every other Job in Kamosu, because a 220 MB download and a whole
	library's worth of inference are exactly what a Job is for (ADR 0032).
