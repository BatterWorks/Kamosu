<!--
	The + at the end of the search box: one way in for every new recipe (#174).

	Tapping it opens a small list hanging from it with five sources, and each
	one does its thing in place (ADR 0027): a link opens the address field under
	the search row, a Bundle (a Kamosu zip file) opens the phone's own picker
	straight away, a PDF opens it too and raises the sheet a paste is checked
	on (#176, a row of its own by the choice on #174), pasted text opens
	a box for it under the search row (#175, chosen there), and writing one
	asks for a title under the search row. The acts are `$lib/adding`'s, the
	same ones the dead ends below offer.

	**The arrangement was chosen on 27 September 2026** from two
	options drawn over the real Recipes and Home screens (option 1, recorded on
	#174): beside the search box, a list hanging from the +, Recipes only. It
	replaced the quiet "Add a recipe from a link · from a recipe file" row #93
	put above the shelf, which could not write a recipe at all. Before this the
	only way to write one on a full library was a search that matched nothing,
	and "Chicken curry" in a library holding a chicken dish never does.

	**The + stays when nothing is found**, beside the three big offers there.
	It is small and always in the same place, and hiding it on exactly the
	screen where adding is on your mind would be the stranger choice.

	The list is a disclosure, not an ARIA menu: five ordinary buttons behind a
	button that says whether it is open. A menu role promises arrow-key
	behaviour, and five buttons in the tab order need none of it.

	**Offline all five wait for the server** and say so in their own row,
	greyed, as every act that needs it does (#76). None is queued: the outbox
	keeps Attempts and the shopping list, never a new recipe (ADR 0013). The
	rows are drawn here rather than with `NeedsServer`, whose button holds one
	line of words and no icon.

	**A PDF, a Kamosu zip file or a link can be dropped on Recipes instead**
	(#204), and is the same act as its row here: `DropARecipe` holds no act of
	its own, only this +'s `adding`, and offline it says what the row says.
