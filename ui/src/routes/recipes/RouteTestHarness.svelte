	Test-only. SvelteKit takes the route's `snapshot` as a reader leaves Recipes
	and hands it back when they go back (#191). A test has no browser history to
	walk, so this renders the real route and lends out that same `snapshot`: the
	test plays SvelteKit's part, leaving with `capture` and coming back with
	`restore`.
