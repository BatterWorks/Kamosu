<!--
	One recipe on the shelf: a **noren** — a dyed or photographed ground with a
	cloth band at the hem carrying the recipe's name.

	Chosen on 2026-08-28 from three shelves of the real 86 recipes;
	the reasoning is on issue #62. What the choice settles is that a recipe with
	a Photograph and one without are the *same object* rather than two
	treatments: a Cover already carries its title on a band at its hem (#46), so
	a photograph is given the same band rather than a caption underneath. Card
	height is identical either way, which is why a third of the shelf carrying
	no Photograph does not read as ragged (ADR 0027).

	No Kitchen name appears here, and none could: the shelf Operation sends
	neither the name nor the id.

					The chip carries the Language's code, which is what fits on

					listening to the screen rather than looking at it, since
