<!--
	Choosing the recipe an Ingredient Line names (#87).

	COMPOSITION IS NEVER GUESSED (ADR 0008, in as many words): matching
	`500 g plain flour` against a flour recipe is the kind of cleverness that is
	wrong more often than it is right. So this opens with NOTHING SELECTED and
	nothing suggested. It is a library you search, and the only thing that makes
	a line a Component is somebody picking a recipe out of it.

	IT RAISES THE LIBRARY OVER THE PAGE YOU ARE STANDING ON, which is the
	treatment chosen on 20 September 2026 against direction A (#83) and
	is why this is a sheet rather than a route. Going to the shelf and coming
	back would lose the line you were on — and on the writing screen it would
	lose everything typed since the last save.

	IT NAMES A LINEAGE, NEVER A BRANCH OR A VERSION (ADR 0008). `search_recipes`
	answers one entry per Lineage already, so the pointer is the id that entry
	carries — which is what makes it go on resolving to whatever Branch of the
	dough its reader holds, rather than to the copy that happened to be on this
	screen the day somebody linked it.

	THE RECIPE YOU ARE STANDING IN IS NOT HIDDEN FROM THE LIST. It reads as an
	odd thing to pick, and it is, but refusing it here would be a rule of this
	screen's own invention: ADR 0008 settled that cycles are never refused and
	that unfolding stops at a repeat instead, because a loop can be assembled
	from two halves on two servers and arrive already formed.
