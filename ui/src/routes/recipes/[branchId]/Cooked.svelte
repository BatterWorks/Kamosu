<!--
	Cooked (#59). How this dish has actually gone: how many times, when last,
	and each Person's most recent verdict with their name.

	There is no average here and no way to build one, which is ADR 0015 working
	rather than a rule anybody has to remember — a rating is a word, and only
	the newest one each Person gave ever arrives, so a verdict somebody has
	since superseded cannot drag down a recipe that was fixed months ago. A
	Person who cooked and said nothing simply does not appear: silence is not a
	score of zero.

	A verdict given on a Version other than the newest says so in small words
	under the name (#229, ADR 0005's quiet mark), so a "no" from before the
	recipe was fixed is not read as a "no" to the recipe as it stands. The
	words lead to that Version where this recipe still carries it, and to the
	Thread where a later save folded it away. A verdict on a variation or a
	Translation is no older state of this recipe: it says "another", and leads
	to the Thread, where the Branches are side by side.

	Worded impersonally, as the delete confirmation is (`DeleteRecipe.svelte`):
	the count is the household's, never the reader's.
