<!--
	Correcting a Reading, in place, on the line it belongs to (#81; #32 item 193:
	"a bad Reading is a tap to fix on screen").

	Three things about this are decisions rather than styling:

	It opens UNDER THE LINE and nowhere else. The written Ingredient Line is the
	truth of the ingredient (ADR 0002) and the Reading is Kamosu's understanding
	of it, so the place to disagree with the understanding is beside the words it
	was read from — not on a settings screen, not in a queue of things to review.

	It makes NO VERSION. `set_reading` writes to the Branch's current head and
	nothing else, so a corrected Reading never appears in the Thread as a change
	to the recipe. The cook did not edit their recipe; they told Kamosu it had
	misread one. An append-only history that recorded the second as the first
	would be lying about what happened.

	It sends the WHOLE Reading, every time. `set_reading` takes amount, unit and
	target together and replaces what is there — there is no per-field patch, so
	a field left blank here is a field cleared, not a field left alone. All three
	blank clears the Reading entirely, which is what "Kamosu read nothing here"
	sends: a line with no Reading is an ordinary state, not a failure (ADR 0002).

	ON A COMPONENT, THE POINTER IS CARRIED AND THE TARGET FIELD IS NOT OFFERED
	(#50, ADR 0008). A Reading's target is either a Food's written word or the
	Lineage of a Recipe, never both, and the Core refuses a Reading claiming to
	be both. So a line naming a recipe says which one instead of offering a word
	to type, and its amount and Unit are corrected as on any other line — which
	is what changes how much of that recipe is wanted.

	Because the whole Reading is sent every time, leaving the Lineage out would
	not leave it alone: it would clear it, and a Component would quietly become
	an ordinary ingredient the first time somebody fixed its amount. So it is
	carried explicitly. "Kamosu read nothing here" still clears everything, the
	pointer included.

	SINCE #87 THE POINTER IS ALSO MADE AND UNMADE HERE. Until then `set_reading`
	could attach one and nothing in the interface called it, so a Component
	could only be made by an agent at the MCP door or by `curl` — and everything
	built on top of it, the unfolding and the annexe and the Passenger on a
	Share Link, was reachable only for a Component somebody had made that way.

	It belongs here for the reason everything else in this box does: this is
	already where you disagree with Kamosu's reading of a line, and saying "this
	line is a recipe" is exactly that disagreement — Kamosu read a Food and it
	is a Recipe. The two are one slot (ADR 0008), so they are one control, and
	picking a recipe puts the target field away rather than sitting beside it.

	NOTHING HERE GUESSES. The picker opens with nothing selected and suggests
	nothing, because ADR 0008 refuses matching `500 g plain flour` against a
	flour recipe in as many words.

		THE WAY TO THE FOOD ITSELF (#107). One line, not a panel: everything a
		Food needs saying — its names in three Languages, what a cup of it
		weighs, how many lines point at it — is a screen's worth, and this box
		already carries five controls.

		It carries the SAVED word rather than what is in the box above, because
		the saved word is the one that resolved to a Food. Linking to whatever
		somebody is halfway through typing would go looking for a Food that does
		not exist yet.

		It hands over the WORD and not an id, because a Reading has no id to
		hand: a Food is instance-local and `reading_schema` keeps an id out of
		the Reading deliberately, so that a Reading means the same thing in a
		Bundle on somebody else's instance. The Foods screen resolves the word,
		and shows both where two Foods answer to it (ADR 0022) rather than
		guessing which was meant.

		Matcha, like every other way out of this page into another (#50).
