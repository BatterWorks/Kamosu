<!--
	Deleting this recipe (#120). Set apart from the grid of acts above, below
	a rule and a gap, as small underlined text rather than another tile. That
	was the choice of 22 September 2026 and option 1 of the audit of
	9 October 2026 kept it (#220, chosen on 10 October over a list of rows in
	which it was the last).

	The reasoning is about the thumb, not the look. Everything above is the
	same shape, and *Add to shopping list* is the one people tap most often
	without reading; a destructive tile beside it is a mis-tap waiting to
	happen. Something that is not button-shaped, past the end of the acts,
	cannot be reached by the habit that reaches for those.

	NOT in Writing, where the mockup drew it: that screen holds an unsaved
	draft the whole time it is open, and a screen that can both lose your
	typing and destroy the recipe is asking two very different questions with
	one set of buttons.

	`NeedsServer` because deleting is a write against the recipes, which are
	the server's side of the line and never queued (ADR 0013). The outbox
	carries your own history, never the recipes — and it queues from an
	allowlist, so this is already true rather than arranged.

	Only on a recipe you write (#131): deleting is a change, and anybody else's
	version is theirs to keep or delete, so offering it would only ever be
	offering a refusal. The recipe screen draws this only there.

	The confirmation is drawn here too, on the reading page, and goes with it:
	a read of the recipe that fails while it is open takes it away along with
	the recipe it was about (#188).

<!--
	The confirmation, in the one sheet Kamosu asks every irreversible thing
	through (#103).

	It names three facts and no more. The recipe's name, so there is no doubt
	which copy you meant — the route is per-Branch, so a delete offered here is
	never ambiguous. That the cooking history stays, because that is the thing
	a person would most expect a delete to take and the reassurance is the
	whole point of saying it. And the Share Link, **only when one is live**.

	No big figure leads it. The sheet's own note says the number should be the
	thing you are deciding about, and here there is not one: a large `11` over
	a delete button reads as eleven things going, which is the exact opposite
	of what this sheet is promising.

	THE COUNT IS THE HOUSEHOLD'S, NEVER THE READER'S, so every phrase here is
	impersonal — "all 11 times this was cooked", not "you cooked". A recipe is
	held by a Kitchen rather than a person (ADR 0007) and `cooked.count` tallies
	every member's Attempts across the whole Lineage, the translation's
	included. "You cooked this 11 times", said to somebody who cooked it twice,
	is a plain untruth in the one sheet that most needs to be believed. The
	Cooked section on the recipe screen is worded impersonally for exactly this
	reason; these must not drift apart.
