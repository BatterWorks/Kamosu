<!--
	What a recipe says about its Language, on the recipe (#106, ADR 0006).

	**It says nothing unless there is something to say**, which is the
	choice of 22 September 2026 against a Languages section drawn on every
	recipe and against moving the whole subject onto the Thread. The reasoning
	is his and worth keeping: the shelf already settled that Kamosu marks a
	Language only when it is not the one the reader asked for, and the dev
	library is 258 English recipes out of 295. A section reading
	*English · you are reading this* on nearly every recipe its owner has would
	say something they can already see. The cost accepted is that starting a
	translation sits two taps in, behind the Language control at the foot.

	So an ordinary English recipe with no Translation draws NOTHING HERE — not
	an empty row, not a heading, not a dash. That is the whole point, and a
	later change that gives this component an empty state undoes the choice.

	WHAT IT DRAWS, when it draws:

	  · this recipe is a Translation — which Language it renders, as a link to
	    the recipe it renders, because a Translation is an ordinary Branch and
	    walking to it is walking to a recipe (ADR 0006);
	  · that Translation has fallen behind — said as a SENTENCE and never as a
	    number. `versions_behind` is exact, and "two versions behind" means
	    nothing to a cook who has not read the source. "The English has been
	    changed twice since this was translated" is the same fact in words that
	    tell you what to do about it;
	  · the source is not on this instance — said as unanswerable rather than
	    as zero, which is the one thing the Core is careful about here and the
	    one thing a screen could quietly throw away;
	  · the Lineage has other Languages — one line each, each a link.

	UNKNOWN DRAWS NOTHING, EVER (ADR 0006). A recipe honestly written in two
	Languages is offered nothing, marked nothing and nagged about nothing from
	the moment it is said, and that is the whole of what Unknown buys. It is
	guarded here explicitly rather than left to fall out of the data, because
	falling out of the data is how it comes back.

	NOTHING HERE IS AN ACT. Saying what Language this is, and starting a
	translation, both mint a Version and both live at the foot with the other
	things that change the recipe. This is a line of the recipe's own facts.

	No heading and no wrapper when there is nothing: `{#each}` over an empty
	list draws nothing at all, which is what an ordinary recipe must get.

	The WHOLE SENTENCE is the link rather than one word inside it. On a phone
	that is a target a thumb can hit, and it keeps the phrase in one piece for
	the translator — a link spliced into the middle of a sentence is a phrase
	that cannot be reordered, and French and Spanish both reorder this one.
