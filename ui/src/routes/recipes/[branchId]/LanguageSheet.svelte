<!--
	Saying what Language a recipe is in, and starting a Translation (#106,
	ADR 0006).

	IT IS A SHEET RAISED OVER THE PAGE, the same shape as `TagSheet` and
	`ComponentPicker`: a scrim, a header saying what it is for, a scrolling
	list, one way out at the foot. A person who has met one has met all three.

	THIS ONE MINTS A VERSION, AND SAYS SO — which is exactly what separates it
	from the two sheets it looks like. Tagging (#104) and relating (#105) are
	notes on a Kitchen's own shelf and appear nowhere in the Thread. Saying
	what Language a recipe is in is a change TO the recipe: it appends an
	occurrence of the head content carrying the new Language, so it leaves a
	trace in an otherwise append-only history (ADR 0006). The sentence under
	the heading says so before anything is tapped, and it is not an apology —
	it is the difference a reader has to know.

	UNKNOWN IS OFFERED, AND REFUSED IN PLACE WHERE IT CANNOT APPLY. A recipe
	that is a Translation, or that has one, is by definition written in the one
	Language that Translation renders, so the Core refuses Unknown on it. The
	row is drawn either way and says why it cannot be taken, rather than
	vanishing: a choice that disappears without explanation reads as a bug, and
	the reason is the interesting part.

	TRANSLATING IS A WRITING ACT, NOT A TAP. `start_translation` takes the
	whole recipe as it now reads in the new Language — it is a Branch with
	content, not a flag — so this sheet cannot make one on its own. It hands
	the chosen Language up, and the page opens the writing screen on a draft of
	this recipe's words for them to be replaced. That is what translating is.

	NOTHING HERE NAMES A TRANSLATION AS ANYTHING BUT A RECIPE. There is no
	Translation object in Kamosu and no screen may invent one: what this makes
	is an ordinary Branch of the same Lineage, and the sentence beside the
	control says so in those terms.
