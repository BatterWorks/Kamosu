<!--
	Test-only. The three pieces of #106 take plain facts as props — `Recipe.svelte`
	reads them off `get_recipe` and `get_thread` and hands them down — so a test
	drives them directly rather than through a whole recipe page it is not
	testing. Each is drawn only when the test asks for it, so a test of the line
	is not also a test of the sheet.
