<!--
	One line the two Branches do not share — an Ingredient Line or a Step, and
	the same component for both, because a Ghost is one mechanism seen from two
	sides rather than two mechanisms.

	At rest it says in words what it is. A struck-through line with nothing
	beside it reads like something crossed off a shopping list rather than a real
	line of a real recipe, so every marked line and every Ghost is named.

	Tapped, it unfolds the other side IN PLACE — never a second column, never a
	second screen — and offers to carry the line across into your recipe.
