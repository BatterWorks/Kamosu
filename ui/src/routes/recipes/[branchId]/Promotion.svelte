<!--
	Promotion offered on the recipe (#58, ADR 0005): a band above `Cook this`
	saying that a cooking of this dish departed from the words below, and
	offering to keep them.

	IT IS HERE RATHER THAN IN THE DIARY, and that was the choice on
	4 September 2026 against a treatment that put it beside the cooking's
	rating. The argument that won: what you are being asked is a question about
	the recipe — should these words become part of it — and this is where the
	recipe's Versions already live. You are standing in the thing you would be
	changing, with the Thread one control away.

	THE DIARY OFFERS IT TOO, SINCE #210, and asks nothing. Having to leave the
	diary and find the recipe is why a tweak got kept late or not at all, so an
	open cooking there has a section of its own (`cooked/KeepCooking.svelte`)
	that keeps through the same Operation. The question, and the answer
	"Leave it in the diary", are still only here.

	PRESSING IT DOES NOT MINT A VERSION. It opens what you would be keeping,
	and the save is a second, deliberate tap. Promotion is the point at which an
	Attempt's freedoms end and the recipe's append-only rules begin, so the one
	irreversible act on this screen is not something a thumb can spend by
	brushing past it. When the recipe's own editing screen lands (#83) this
	expansion becomes it, pre-filled, and the shape does not change.

	WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE CORE'S READING, never its own. `as_cooked.against` is
	the As Cooked laid over the Version cooked by the same Pairing two Branches
	are laid over each other with (ADR 0019). Nothing here matches a line to a
	line: index arithmetic in a screen would be wrong exactly where a cook
	dropped a line or added one, which they may.

	ALREADY PROMOTED NEEDS NO FLAG. An As Cooked's `version_id` is a fingerprint
	of its own content, so once promoted it simply IS one of the Branch's
	Versions — and the band is not drawn. Nothing stored can disagree with that.

	The fingerprint has one consequence worth knowing, and it is deliberate: a
	cook who happened to cook a recipe into EXACTLY a previous state of its own
	text holds an As Cooked whose id is already in the chain, so the band does
	not offer. The alternative — comparing against the head alone — would ask
	again after every later edit of the recipe, which is a nag rather than a
	question. Those words are in the recipe's history either way, and the
	cooking keeps its own record of them.

	ON A RECIPE THAT IS NOT YOURS TO CHANGE, KEEPING IS A COPY, and the band
	says so in the writing screen's own words before the tap, by the one rule
	the Core answers on the recipe as `writes` (ADR 0041). The Copy lands in
	your own Cookbook, so there is nothing to ask. Kept, the Copy is where the
	cook goes next: the recipe on screen did not change, and a "Kept" over it
	would say it had.
