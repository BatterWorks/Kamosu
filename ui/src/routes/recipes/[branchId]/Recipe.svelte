<!--
	The recipe screen, and — when a second Branch of the same Lineage is on this
	instance — the Divergence.

	ADR 0014, which refuses the obvious thing: holding two Branches shows TWO
	WHOLE RECIPES WITH A SWITCH BETWEEN THEM, never a difference. There is no
	comparison screen here, no side-by-side and no object called "the
	difference". You stand inside one recipe or the other — whole, in order,
	cookable — and the threshold at the top moves you between them.

	A line the other Branch has and yours has not is a GHOST: struck through, in
	the position it holds over there, saying whose it is. A removal seen from
	their side and an addition seen from yours are the same object, so one
	mechanism serves both and the page reads the same whichever recipe you are in.

	Which line is which is read against the Branch Point by the `divergence`
	Operation (ADR 0019). Nothing here pairs anything, and no line carries an id.

	THE PAGE'S OWN LAYOUT was chosen on 29 August 2026 against three
	full mockups drawn on real recipes, and the reasoning is on #81 rather than
	repeated here. What it settled:

	  · the hero is the photograph at 320px with the title standing ON it, over
	    an indigo wash — near-solid at the hem, so the title is readable over a
	    photograph whose colours nobody chose;
	  · with no photograph the Cover leads and carries the title the same way,
	    bare, because its dye was chosen and needs no wash (#46). Only the 10.5px
	    Source line cannot clear the contrast bar there, so on a Cover it is set
	    on paper beneath the hero instead;
	  · the meta is one full-bleed ruled strip of three cells;
	  · an Ingredient Line is a hairline-ruled row led by a small indigo square,
	    its Reading subordinate beneath it;
	  · a Step is a number in a narrow column, in indigo, and the step at body
	    size;
	  · a Section, in either list, is the quiet uppercase heading over a rule.

	The Reading is also CORRECTED here, in place, on the line it belongs to (#32
	item 193) — see `Correcting.svelte`, which owns why that makes no Version.

	No mark distinguishes a line Kamosu read from one it did not (ADR 0002): the
	Reading is simply there or it is not. A badge that fires sometimes teaches
	people it fires always.

	THE SUBORDINATE LINE IS ONE SLOT (#49, ADR 0016). Scaling and conversion are
	one act and share it with the Reading echo, so a row never carries two small
	lines under its written one. What the slot holds, in order: the converted
	amount where this reader needs one — `about 250 g` under `2 cups flour` for
	a metric cook — and otherwise the echo of what Kamosu read. A reader already
	in her own measures gets the echo, because the conversion has nothing to say
	and a blank slot would tell her less than the echo does. Both are quiet, both
	are visibly Kamosu's rather than the cook's, and neither is ever a badge.

	SINCE #71 THE ECHO IS SILENT WHERE IT WOULD ONLY REPEAT THE LINE, which is
	the rule the conversion already obeyed. The echo was chosen while a Reading
	existed only because somebody had typed one — it was the only way to see
	what Kamosu held. Now Kamosu reads every line it can, so an unfiltered echo
	would set `Za’tar` under `Za’tar` on most rows, and would appear on exactly
	the lines Kamosu managed to read: the badge ADR 0002 refuses, arrived at
	sideways. The echo that survives is the one that earns its place — a Reading
	somebody CORRECTED, saying something the written line does not.

	A Step's slot holds its conversions — the oven in the other system, on the
	conventional ladder, and each amount it writes — drawn straight after what
	each converts, never written into the sentence (#150).

	A COMPONENT UNFOLDS IN PLACE, ITS STEPS AT THE FOOT (#50, ADR 0008). An
	Ingredient whose Reading names a Lineage rather than a Food is a Component —
	the dough inside a pizza — and it is an ordinary Ingredient Line in every
	respect but two: the square in front of it is matcha rather than indigo, and
	it opens.

	What it opens into was chosen on 3 September 2026 against two
	treatments drawn on real recipes, recorded on #50. He was offered A · the
	nest, which put the inner recipe's Steps inside the row with its
	Ingredients, and chose B · the annexe:

	  · its INGREDIENT LINES unfold here, indented under the row behind a matcha
	    rule, already scaled by how much of that recipe this line asks for — so
	    the list stays a list you can shop from;
	  · its STEPS are set at the FOOT of the page, after this recipe's Method,
	    under a heading of their own. Never spliced into the method: composition
	    says WHAT and never WHEN, and Kamosu does not know the dough is made the
	    day before.

	What decided it was the library rather than taste. Every dough in the real
	86-recipe export runs to twelve or fifteen Steps, so the nest put fifteen
	steps between `Dough for 2 pizzas` and `250 g mozzarella` in the case the
	whole feature is written about.

	NONE OF THE ARITHMETIC OR THE WORDING IS HERE. How much of the inner recipe
	is wanted, its scaled amounts, and the one line beneath a Component's
	written line all arrive worded from the Core — which is why the Share Link
	page and an agent at the MCP door say exactly what this screen says.

				recipe is written in, and Kamosu does not merge (ADR 0013, #76).
