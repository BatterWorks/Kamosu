<!--
	A recipe's Related Recipes, on the recipe (#105, #52).

	**A strip of the shelf's own cards, between the Method and Cooked**, which is
	the choice of 22 September 2026 against a section of rows near the
	foot and a chip row beside the Tags. The reasoning is worth keeping:
	a related recipe is a DISH, so it is drawn as a dish. It wears the face it
	wears on the shelf — its photograph, or its Cover — at the shelf's own width,
	and never the shape of a label. The cost accepted is that anything past the
	second card is off the right edge until the strip is slid.

	It sits after the Method and the annexe and before Cooked, inside the layout
	#81 settled rather than reopening it. The strip is drawn on EVERY recipe,
	linked or not, following the choice made for Tags (#104): a library that
	arrives with 86 recipes and no links grows none if the only way in is hidden.

	A LINK IS BETWEEN TWO LINEAGES, UNTYPED, AND ONE LINK IS BOTH DIRECTIONS
	(#52, ADR 0025). Making it from either end makes the same single link, so
	there is nothing here that could be "the other way round". Nothing on this
	strip says the two recipes are joined, because they are not: no Lineage is
	merged, no Version is minted, and a card is a way to walk over there and
	nothing more.

	IT NEVER TRAVELS. Related Recipes stay behind a Bundle, a Share and a Sheet
	(ADR 0020, ADR 0023). This is a note on your own shelf, like filing (#104).

	A LINK TO A LINEAGE THAT HAS LEFT THE SHELF READS AS A NAME. The Core answers
	those with a remembered title and no Branch id, deliberately, because text is
	better than a broken pointer — so the card is drawn without a picture, does
	not open, and says why. Since #105 it can also be taken off: `RelatedSheet`
	names it by its Lineage, which a deleted recipe still has.

	NOTHING HERE MINTS A VERSION (ADR 0035). Relating does not appear in the
	Thread and is never presented as a change to the recipe, so there is no
	unsaved tray, no *save* and no *this will make a new version*.
