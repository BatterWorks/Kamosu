<!--
	Which recipes this one goes with (#105).

	**Making and unmaking a link are the same question asked twice**, so they
	live in one sheet: a list you tick. There is no second way to do it — no
	remove button on the strip behind, no long-press, no swipe. `TagSheet` proved
	the shape and this is deliberately the same one (a scrim, a header saying
	what the sheet is for, a field that takes the caret, a scrolling list of
	ticks, one way out at the foot), because relating and filing are the same
	kind of act and a person who has met one sheet has met both.

	IT IS A SHEET RAISED OVER THE PAGE, not a route, for `ComponentPicker`'s
	reason: going to another screen and coming back loses the place you were
	standing in — and on a recipe page that is the step you had reached.

	THE LINKS THIS RECIPE ALREADY HAS ARE LISTED FIRST, above whatever the search
	found. That is not decoration: a link to a Lineage that has left the shelf
	appears in NO search, because it is not on the shelf to be found, so listing
	only search results would leave exactly the link you most want to remove
	unreachable. It is named by its Lineage when unticked, which a deleted recipe
	still has, and that is the whole reason `set_related_recipe` learned to take
	one (#105).

	IT NAMES A LINEAGE, NEVER A BRANCH OR A VERSION (#52, ADR 0025). The link is
	between two Lineages and one link is both directions, so ticking from either
	end changes the same row. Nothing here joins the two: no Lineage is merged,
	and there is no operation that would.

	NOTHING HERE IS A CHANGE TO THE RECIPE (ADR 0035). No Version is minted,
	nothing reaches the Thread, and no *unsaved changes* tray is drawn. The sheet
	says so once, in the empty state, and then stops explaining itself.
