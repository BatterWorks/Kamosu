<!--
	Which Tags this recipe has (#104).

	**It does one job.** Renaming, merging and deleting a Tag are not here, and
	that is the choice of 22 September 2026, made after seeing them here:
	"I don't think a recipe page is the place to rename tags, it makes no sense."
	They live in Settings → Tags, because they are about the whole library rather
	than about the dish on screen. What is left is the only question this sheet
	should ask: which of your words describe this recipe.

	IT IS A SHEET RAISED OVER THE PAGE, not a route, for `ComponentPicker`'s
	reason: going to another screen and coming back loses the place you were
	standing in. The two are deliberately the same shape — a scrim, a header
	that says what the sheet is for, a field that takes the caret, a scrolling
	list, one way out at the foot — because a person who has met one has met
	both.

	A WORD NOBODY HAS USED YET IS MADE HERE. `create_tag` answers with the Tag
	the Cookbook already has for that word rather than a second one, so two people
	reaching for *dessert* have agreed rather than collided (#51) — which means
	this screen never has to ask whether a word is taken.

	NOTHING HERE IS A CHANGE TO THE RECIPE (ADR 0035). No Version is minted,
	nothing appears in the Thread, and no *unsaved changes* tray is drawn. The
	sheet says so once, in the empty state, and then stops explaining itself.
