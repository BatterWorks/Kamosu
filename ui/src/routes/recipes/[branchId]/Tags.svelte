<!--
	A recipe's Tags, on the recipe (#104).

	**The row is on every recipe, tagged or not**, which is the choice of
	22 September 2026 against the quieter option that drew nothing until a recipe
	had a Tag. The reasoning is his and worth keeping: a library that arrives
	with 86 recipes and no Tags at all grows none if the only way in is a button
	at the foot of a long page. The cost accepted is one quiet row on the recipes
	nobody ever Tags.

	It sits under the meta strip, where the recipe's facts end and its content
	begins — the Tags are what this Kitchen says about the dish, above the dish
	itself.

	A TAG IS A WAY OF GETTING AROUND, so a chip is a link to the shelf filtered
	by it rather than a label you can only read (#104, ADR 0027). It is a real
	filter and not a search for the word: *spicy* means the recipes you tagged,
	never the one whose title happens to say spicy.

	NOTHING HERE MINTS A VERSION (ADR 0035). Tagging does not appear in the
	Thread and is never presented as a change to the recipe, so there is no
	unsaved tray, no *save* and no *this will make a new version*. Opening an old
	Version shows today's Tags, on purpose: filing is present tense.

	Adding one waits for the server, like editing (#76, ADR 0013). An offline
	queue for this would be a merge of two Kitchens' filing, and Kamosu does not
	merge.
