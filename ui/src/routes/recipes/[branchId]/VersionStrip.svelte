<!--
	The switch between the versions of one recipe (#131, screen
	choice 1 of 24 September 2026: a strip of every version).

	ADR 0014 designed a threshold for exactly two Branches: you stood in yours
	and crossed into theirs. Under ADR 0041 three or four versions of one dish
	in a family Kitchen is ordinary — yours, your mother's, your brother's, your
	vegetarian one — so every version is a chip across the top, and tapping one
	opens it. Each still has an address of its own, so the page is always the
	recipe it says it is.

	WHAT A MARK COMPARES AGAINST: YOUR OWN. Whatever version is open, the lines
	marked are the ones it does not share with your own recipe (`yoursAmong`,
	#136: your unnamed one, or once named, the one you have kept longest)
	— the question a reader has is *how is theirs different from mine*, never
	*how is Luc's different from Hélène's*. On your own there is nothing to
	mark, and the strip says how to see the others instead. A reader with no
	version of their own sees no marks at all.

	The band keeps the threshold's colours and its split curtain: the page's
	paper still changes with whose recipe you are reading.
