<!--
	Writing a recipe (#83). The other half of #81, which only reads.

	THE PAGE IS THE PAGE. Direction A was chosen on 20 September 2026,
	against four full mockups drawn on Dan Dan Noodles out of the real
	86-recipe export, and the reasoning is on #83 rather than repeated here.
	What it settled, and what this file has to keep true:

	  · there is NO SECOND SCREEN. Hero, the facts, Ingredients, and the Method
	    underneath them, in the order #81 puts them, each part becoming a field
	    where it already sits. A separate compose screen was drawn (B) and
	    rejected, so moving any part of this onto its own route undoes the
	    choice;
	  · a long list is ONE RUN OF TYPING. Return at the end of a line makes the
	    next one, so twenty-one lines is not twenty-one taps of *add another*;
	  · both lists carry BOTH controls — a line or a step, and a heading — and
	    each drops the new thing in where the cursor is, so a heading goes into
	    the middle of a list without retyping what follows it.

	One argument was put for the separate screen and it was wrong:
	that a long list gets more room there. The hero scrolls away, so it does
	not. That mistake is recorded on #83 so nobody re-derives it.

	AN INGREDIENT LINE IS ONE FREE-TEXT FIELD (ADR 0002, #43). Never an amount
	box, a unit box and a food box. `2 poignées de farine, environ` goes in and
	comes out as typed, and nothing here rewrites a character of it. What
	Kamosu understands OF that line — the amount, the Unit, the Food — is the
	Reading, and it is corrected on the reading page and is no part of this
	screen (ADR 0021).

	ONE PART OF THE READING IS HERE, AND ONLY ONE (#87): whether the line names
	a RECIPE rather than a Food. It was settled on 20 September 2026 that the
	act of saying *this line is a recipe* is designed once against both screens
	and wears the same small matcha control on both, so it is here as well as in
	the reading page's corrector.

	It is not the exception it looks like. The other three are Kamosu's reading
	of words you wrote, which is why correcting them belongs where you read
	them. This one is not readable from the words at all and never will be:
	ADR 0008 refuses matching `500 g plain flour` against a flour recipe in as
	many words. Only the person typing the line knows, and this is where they
	are.

	WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHY IT IS PAID AFTER THE SAVE. A Reading is keyed to the
	Version it belongs to, and the Version this screen is writing does not exist
	yet — so a pointer cannot be attached until the save lands. It is applied
	immediately afterwards, with `set_reading`, against the Version that just
	landed. The recipe is re-read first for one reason: `set_reading` replaces
	the WHOLE Reading, and the amount and the Unit it would otherwise clear are
	the ones the Core has just worked out of the new line. `500 g pizza dough`
	losing its 500 does not look broken — it silently means the whole dough
	(ADR 0008).

	A SECTION IS A REAL OBJECT in both lists, not a line pretending to be one:
	it is stored as `kind: "section"` and it survives a save as itself.

	A LINE IS DRAGGED, AND THE LIST REARRANGES UNDER IT. You put the line where
	you can see it going, rather than describing the move and watching it
	happen afterwards. This is the handle the mockup drew, and it is the
	control that was approved, so a two-step *move, then choose where* is not
	a substitute for it.

	It is built on pointer events. HTML5 drag-and-drop does not fire on touch
	at all, which on a phone-first app would make rearranging a desktop-only
	feature. The handle captures the pointer, so the drag survives the row
	moving out from under the finger — which happens immediately, because that
	is the point. The arrow keys move a row one place at a time, because a
	control that can only be dragged cannot be reached from a keyboard and
	`svelte-check` counts that as a build failure here (ADR 0012).

	THE SAVE SAYS WHICH OF TWO THINGS IT IS ABOUT TO DO (#54), before it does
	it, in fixed words, and the two are not the same control. Saving a recipe
	one of your Kitchens holds writes a Version on that Branch. Saving one they
	do not forks a Branch of the same Lineage, held by you. Whether this is a
	fork is read off the Kitchens the caller actually cooks in, never guessed.

	WHAT A SAVE DID IS SAID BY THE PAGE, NOT BY THIS SCREEN. Saving closes this
	screen, so a line drawn here would be destroyed before anybody read it —
	which is exactly what happened the first time it was written that way. The
	outcome goes up through `onSaved` and the recipe page says it.

	There are two things worth saying. A second save by the same Hand within
	`COLLAPSE_WINDOW_SECONDS` joins the Version already being shaped instead of
	appending (`src/core/recipes.rs`), and a save that silently made no Thread
	entry reads as a save that did not happen. And a Copy lands on a DIFFERENT
	Branch: the answer's `branch_id` is the new one, so the page has to go
	there or the cook is left reading the recipe they did not change.

	OFFLINE THIS SCREEN IS NOT REACHED (ADR 0013, #76). Editing needs the
	server and the button that opens this says so, drawn with `NeedsServer`.
	There is no queue, because an offline edit queue is a merge.

	THERE IS STILL NO DELETE HERE, and now for a better reason. The mockup drew
	one; until #120 Kamosu had no `delete_recipe` Operation at all, and a
	button for an Operation that does not exist is worse than its absence.

	The Operation exists now, and the act lives on the recipe page instead —
	set apart below the actions, where `Recipe.svelte` records why. Keeping it
	off this screen was decided rather than inherited: this screen holds an
	unsaved draft the whole time it is open, so a delete sitting beside Save
	would let one set of buttons ask both "keep what I typed?" and "destroy the
	recipe?". Those are not questions to answer in the same glance.
