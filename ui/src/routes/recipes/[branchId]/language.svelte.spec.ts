/**
 * A recipe's Language, and reaching its Translations (#106, ADR 0006).
 *
 * **The fixture these exist for is `language_offer` set to a real Language.**
 * Before #106 the field appeared seven times in the whole frontend and was
 * `null` every time, which is exactly why nothing ever went red while the
 * interface threw the offer away. A test that sets it to null tests the silent
 * case and calls it coverage.
 *
 * What these guard above everything:
 *
 *   · an ordinary recipe says NOTHING about its Language. That is the
 *     choice of 22 September 2026 and the reason Option 1 was chosen over a
 *     Languages section drawn on every recipe, so an empty state appearing
 *     here later is a regression and not a polish;
 *   · the offer is an OFFER. Nothing is ever applied without a tap, which is
 *     asserted rather than assumed — the stand-in records every ask a screen
 *     makes, so "never called" is a thing a test can prove;
 *   · **unknown is silent**, permanently. No prompt, no badge, no nag;
 *   · how far behind a Translation has fallen is said in words, and the
 *     unanswerable case is said as unanswerable rather than as zero.
