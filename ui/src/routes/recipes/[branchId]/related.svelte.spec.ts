/**
 * A recipe's Related Recipes, on the recipe (#105, #52).
 *
 * Driven in the three states the ticket asks for, because they are three
 * different screens: a recipe carrying no links, which is what every recipe in
 * a fresh library looks like; one carrying several; and one whose link points
 * at a Lineage that has left the shelf.
 *
 * What these guard above everything:
 *
 * - **nothing here is a change to the recipe** (ADR 0035): no Version is
 *   minted and `save_recipe_version` is never called, which is asserted rather
 *   than assumed, because the stand-in records every ask a screen makes;
 * - **a link to a departed Lineage reads as a name, and can still be taken
 *   off** (#105), which is the one case `set_related_recipe` could not address
 *   before, since a deleted recipe has no Branch to name;
 * - **nothing says the two recipes are joined.** A card is a way to walk over
 *   there, and no Lineage is merged by any of this.
