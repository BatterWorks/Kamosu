<!--
	The share screen (#65, ADR 0026, ADR 0018).

	Two levels of visibility and no third: this recipe is seen by its Kitchen, or
	by anyone holding its link. So there is no scale on this screen and nothing
	to set a point on — one switch, on or off.

	THE STANDING LINE is on the screen at all times, in the same words every
	time. It is not a dialog, there is nothing to dismiss, and there is no
	first-time special case (ADR 0018): a warning seen eighteen months ago is a
	warning that is not there, and its absence afterwards reads as reassurance.
	It sits above the switch rather than beneath it, because it is what the act
	means rather than a footnote to it.

	WHAT TRAVELS WITH IT IS SAID PLAINLY, on the screen, above the switch (#50,
	ADR 0008): "this recipe includes Pizza Dough, which will be readable through
	this link". A Component travels with its parent as a Passenger, because a
	recipe that cannot tell you how to make its own dough is incomplete — and
	that is a thing a person is owed BEFORE they turn sharing on, in the same
	place and the same voice as the standing line, rather than as a dialog to
	dismiss. It does not change the dough's own Visibility: the dough gets no
	page and no link of its own, and is read only through this one.

	THE LINK IS SHOWN FOR AS LONG AS IT LIVES (#171, ADR 0031 as amended), in
	the block it had at minting: the address, Copy and Open, above "End the
	link" (option 1, chosen 26 September 2026). Sending the recipe to a
	second person is copying it again, never ending the link and minting a new
	one, which would break every copy already sent. A link minted before Kamosu
	kept its address has none to show, and the screen says so and how to get one.
