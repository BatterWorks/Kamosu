/**
 * A recipe's tags, on the recipe (#104).

 * Driven in the three states the ticket asks for, because they are three
 * different screens and only one of them is the pretty one: a library with no
 * tags at all, which is what every new instance and this project's own imported
 * corpus look like; a library with a handful; and one recipe carrying several,
 * one of them named in a Language the reader is not using.
 *
 * What these guard above everything: **no tagging act is ever presented as a
 * change to the recipe** (ADR 0035). No Version is minted, nothing is saved,
 * and `save_recipe_version` is never called — which is asserted rather than
 * assumed, because the stand-in records every ask a screen makes.
