/**
 * The Thread's shape (GLOSSARY.md, "Thread"): every Branch's own chain, oldest

 * recursively, so a Branch forking off another Branch (a Copy of a Copy, or
 * a Translation of a Copy) reads the same way a fork off the original trunk
 * does.
 *
 * A Version id is never trusted to be unique across Branches — two Branches
 * that reach identical content hold the same id (ADR 0004) — so a fork is
 * found by comparing each Branch's own chain position by position within the
 * group being split, never by id alone.
