/**
 * How a result says what matched (#62, ADR 0027).
 *
 * A result that cannot explain itself is noise: search *chocolate*, get
 * *Chilli con carne*, and without the 50 g of dark chocolate on the card the
 * search looks broken. The Operation answers where it matched and the line
 * itself; this turns the where into the short label set above the quote.
 *
 * A title match is deliberately unlabelled: the title is already on the tile's
 * band, so quoting it back under the tile would say the same thing twice.
 *
 * A **meaning** match is labelled as one, and only as one. Its quoted line does
 * not contain the words that were typed — that is the whole point of it — so
 * without saying *close in meaning* the card reads as a search gone wrong. That
 * one label says everything the where-label would have said and the thing the
 * where-label could not, which is why it replaces it rather than joining it.

 *
 * Null when there is nothing to mark — a preference never hides a recipe from
 * its owner, and the card says which Language it fell back to (ADR 0006).
 *
 * Takes the two fields it reads rather than a whole shelf `Entry`, so the
 * Related Recipes strip marks a fallback in the same words as the shelf does
 * (#105). A second copy of this mapping is how "In French" becomes "In fr" on
 * one screen and nobody notices — which is why the mapping itself moved to
 * `#lib/language.js` when the recipe screen needed it too (#106), and why this
 * reads it rather than keeping a copy.
