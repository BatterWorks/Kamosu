<!--
	Settings' sections, drawn on whichever of its four pages holds them (#221,
	option 2 of the audit of 9 October 2026): Account (You, Language, Access,
	What Kamosu does not protect), This device (the phone, Measures), Kitchens
	and cookbooks (Your Cookbook, Kitchens, Tags, Foods) and This instance
	(Bring recipes in, This instance, Brought in, Meaning Search). The menu at
	`/settings` is `+page.svelte` beside this; each page is a route that draws
	this with its name.

	One component and not four, because the sections share what they know: the
	Kitchens name the Cookbook, the Tags are named in the Reading Language, and
	whether anybody is signed in gates most of them. Each page reads only what
	its sections need, so the menu reads nothing and Account never lists the
	Kitchens.

		Beneath the Crouton importer on purpose. That control is where an import
		is *started*; this is where every import that ever ran is found again,
		including the forty-seven the importer's own "last report" link could
		never reach.

		The second of the two doors onto a Food (#107). The first is the Reading
		corrector on the recipe itself, which is where a wrong Cup Weight is
		noticed; this one is for the Food you have to go looking for, which is
		every Food whose name in another Language is missing — nothing on a
		recipe naming `salt` tells you a separate `sel` exists elsewhere.

		A door rather than the list itself, which is where Tags above differs: a
		Kitchen has a handful of Tags and this instance has 607 Foods, so the
		list is a screen with a search field on it and not a section anybody
		scrolls past.

		Shown to every Person, because a Food is instance-wide and all five of
		its Operations are `Permission::Person` — correcting one is not an
		Operator's power, and #103 holds the two that are.
