<!--
	Renaming, merging and deleting a Tag — Settings, not the recipe page (#104).

	They were put here on 22 September 2026, after first being shown
	inside the recipe's own tag sheet. The answer was: "I don't think a recipe page is the place
	to rename tags, it makes no sense." That is right, and the line is a useful one
	to keep: the sheet on a recipe answers *which of my words describe this
	dish*, and this answers *what my words are*. One is about a dish and the
	other is about a library.

	THE COUNT IS ON EVERY ROW, and it is the same number the shelf shows for the
	same tag, because both count Lineages (`recipes_with_tag`). That is what
	makes deleting an informed act rather than a leap: *18 recipes lose this
	tag* is a fact you can weigh.

	NOTHING HERE CHANGES A RECIPE (ADR 0035), and the section says so once at the
	top rather than on every row. A rename reaches every recipe carrying the Tag
	immediately, which is the whole point of keeping Tags once per Cookbook and
	is why no recipe has to be walked or re-saved.

	ONE CARD, YOUR COOKBOOK'S (#131, screen choice 5). Tags belong to the
	Cookbook that writes the recipes (question 3), so the words listed here are
	the ones you and your Co-authors file by. A Kitchen-mate's words are theirs
	to rename; the shelf's filter row still merges the same word across every
	Cookbook it shows.

	A TAG IS NAMED PER LANGUAGE, NOT SPLIT BY IT (ADR 0006). So a row shows the
	name in the reader's own Language where there is one, says which Language it
	fell back to where there is not, and offers to add the missing one — which is
	the only place in Kamosu where a Tag known only as *mijoté* can be given an
	English name.
