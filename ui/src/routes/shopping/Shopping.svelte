<!--
	Shopping: one Person's standing choice of what they are about to cook (#73,
	ADR 0024).

	**The choosing is stored; the rows are computed.** Nothing on this screen is
	worked out here — every row, every amount and every word of an amount
	arrives from the Core, which is what lets an agent asked *what is on my
	list* get the identical answer through the other Door. This file decides
	what a row looks like and nothing about what it says.

	**What a row looks like was chosen on 2026-09-01**, out of four
	treatments of one real list served side by side, and the reasoning is
	recorded on issue #73. The shape is *Three admissions*:

	- A row whose amounts added stays on **one line** — the Food reads left, the
	  amount sits right in its own tabular column.
	- A row the arithmetic could not close **breaks open** into the recipes it
	  came from, each amount under the name of the recipe that wanted it. That
	  is the whole point of it: standing in a shop, `about 30 ml + 4 cloves`
	  tells you two amounts but not which dish goes short if you buy one.
	- A row nobody wrote an amount for says **some** where the figure would be,
	  in the quiet ink and in the same slot every other amount uses.
	- A line kept as typed carries **no amount slot at all**.

	The stated cost, which was put in front of him and accepted: a taller row
	now means *Kamosu could not add this*, and that is a shape appearing only
	sometimes. It survives ADR 0015 for the same reason the recipe screen's
	subordinate line does — the two lines are not a badge *about* the amounts,
	they *are* the amounts.

	**Nothing here is ticked** (ADR 0024, ADR 0019). A row is derived from a
	Food and however many recipes mention it, and it changes shape the moment a
	Yield moves, so there is no name to staple a tick to. The list leaves as
	text and something else carries it round the shop.

	**On the wide layout the two things the list holds stand side by side**
	(#202, ADR 0044): the recipes chosen in two fifths of a page as wide as a
	recipe's, staying in view, and what to buy in the other three. Each recipe
	there has − and + either side of how much of it is being shopped for, so
	one more is one tap, and the amount between them still opens the two
	boxes. This was chosen on 6 October 2026 over a column 300 wide that
	kept the phone's sentence. The phone's screen is what it was.
