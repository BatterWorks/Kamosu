 * The service worker: what puts the cookbook on the phone (#76, ADR 0013).

 * SvelteKit bundles and registers this file itself. Everything it decides is
 * in `$lib/offline/worker.ts`, where a test can reach it; this file only hands
 * the browser's events over, and fills the app's own cache on install.
 *
 * A browser runs this only on a secure page — `https://`, or `localhost` — so
 * over plain `http://` none of it exists, which is what the app's "This
 * connection isn't secure" card is there to say.
